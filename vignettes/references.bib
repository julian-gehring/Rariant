	abstract = {Canine transmissible venereal tumor ({CTVT)} is a naturally occurring tumor that can be transmitted between dogs via live tumor cell inoculation. It is also a spontaneous self-regression tumor and its behavior is closely related to host immune responses. Since {CTVT} had been widely used for tumor models in canine cancers, whether this self-regression may overtake the immunity elicited from an exogenous tumor vaccine remains unclear and certainly worthwhile to be investigated. In this study, we used {DCs/tumor} hybrids as a tumor vaccine to evaluate the {CTVT} model. We prepared mature allogeneic dendritic cells from bone marrow and then assessed their phenotype ({CD80}, {CD83}, {CD86}, {CD1a}, {CD11c}, {CD40} and {MHC} {II)}, antigen uptake and presenting abilities. Fused dendritic {cell/CTVT} hybrids were then used as a vaccine, administered three times at two-week intervals via subcutaneous injection near the bilateral auxiliary and inguinal lymph nodes. In comparison with unvaccinated dogs (spontaneous regressed group), within a period of 2.5 months, the vaccinations substantially inhibited tumor progression (p{\textless}0.05) and accelerated the rate of regression by a mechanism involving amplification of the host tumor-specific adaptive immune responses and {NK} cytotoxicity (p{\textless}0.001). Pathologic examination revealed early massive lymphocyte infiltration resulting in final tumor necrosis. In addition, there are not any detectable effects on routine physical, body temperature or blood chemistry examinations. In conclusion, our data furnishes a reference value showing that {CTVT} is a model of potential use for the study of immunity elicited by vaccines against tumors, and also enable early-phase evaluation of the dendritic cell/tumor vaccine in terms of raising host immunity.},

Monochemotherapy with vincristine is considered to be effective, but treatment time until complete clinical remission may vary. The aim of this study was to determine which clinical data at diagnosis could predict the responsiveness of {CTVT} to vincristine chemotherapy. One hundred dogs with {CTVT} entered this prospective study. The animals were treated with vincristine sulfate (0.025 mg/kg) at weekly intervals until the tumor had macroscopically disappeared. The time to complete remission was recorded. A multivariate Cox regression model indicated that larger tumor mass, increased age and therapy during hot and rainy months were independent significant unfavorable predictive factors retarding remission, whereas sex, weight, status as owned dog or breed were of no predictive relevance. Further studies are necessary to investigate whether these results are due to changes in immunological response mechanisms in animals with a diminished immune surveillance, resulting in delays in tumor regression.},

	abstract = {With next-generation {DNA} sequencing technologies, one can interrogate a specific genomic region of interest at very high depth of coverage and identify less prevalent, rare mutations in heterogeneous clinical samples. However, the mutation detection levels are limited by the error rate of the sequencing technology as well as by the availability of variant-calling algorithms with high statistical power and low false positive rates. We demonstrate that we can robustly detect mutations at 0.1\% fractional representation. This represents accurate detection of one mutant per every 1000 wild-type alleles. To achieve this sensitive level of mutation detection, we integrate a high accuracy indexing strategy and reference replication for estimating sequencing error variance. We employ a statistical model to estimate the error rate at each position of the reference and to quantify the fraction of variant base in the sample. Our method is highly specific (99\%) and sensitive (100\%) when applied to a known 0.1\% sample fraction admixture of two synthetic {DNA} samples to validate our method. As a clinical application of this method, we analyzed nine clinical samples of {H1N1} influenza A and detected an oseltamivir (antiviral therapy) resistance mutation in the {H1N1} neuraminidase gene at a sample fraction of 0.18\%.},

We stress the need for restricted estimation of variance in the chi-square function underlying interval estimation (and also point estimation and hypothesis testing).

As for {OR} analysis, we emphasize that the chi-square function, introduced by Cornfield for unstratified data, and extended by Gart to the case of stratified analysis, is based on the efficient score and thus embodies its optimality properties. We provide simulation results to evince the better performance of the proposed (parameter-constrained) procedures over the traditional ones.},

	abstract = {Myelodysplastic syndromes ({MDS)} are a heterogeneous group of chronic hematological malignancies characterized by dysplasia, ineffective hematopoiesis and a variable risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia. Sequencing of {MDS} genomes has identified mutations in genes implicated in {RNA} splicing, {DNA} modification, chromatin regulation and cell signaling. We sequenced 111 genes across 738 patients with {MDS} or closely related neoplasms (including {CMML} and {MDS-MPN)} to explore the role of acquired mutations in {MDS} biology and clinical phenotype. 78\% patients had one or more oncogenic mutations. We identify complex patterns of pairwise association between genes, indicative of epistatic interactions involving components of the spliceosome machinery and epigenetic modifiers. Coupled with inferences on subclonal mutations, these data suggest a hypothesis of genetic 'predestination', in which early driver mutations, typically affecting genes involved in {RNA} splicing, dictate future trajectories of disease evolution with distinct clinical phenotypes. Driver mutations had equivalent prognostic significance whether clonal or subclonal, and leukemia-free survival deteriorated steadily as numbers of driver mutations increased. Thus, analysis of oncogenic mutations in large, well-characterized cohorts of patients illustrates the interconnections between the cancer genome and disease biology, with considerable potential for clinical application.},

Similarly, in other malignancies leukemia cells accumulate mutations during growth, forming heterogeneous cell populations that are subject to Darwinian selection and may respond differentially to treatment. There is therefore a clinical need to monitor changes in the subclonal composition of cancers during disease progression. Here, we use whole-genome sequencing to track subclonal heterogeneity in 3 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients subjected to repeated cycles of therapy. We reveal different somatic mutation profiles in each patient and use these to establish probable hierarchical patterns of subclonal evolution, to identify subclones that decline or expand over time, and to detect founder mutations. We show that clonal evolution patterns are heterogeneous in individual patients. We conclude that genome sequencing is a powerful and sensitive approach to monitor disease progression repeatedly at the molecular level. If applied to future clinical trials, this approach might eventually influence treatment strategies as a tool to individualize and direct cancer treatment.},

	abstract = {Cancer cells evolve from normal cells by somatic mutations and natural selection. Comparing the evolution of cancer cells and that of organisms can elucidate the genetic basis of cancer. Here we analyse somatic mutations in {\textgreater}400 cancer genomes. We find that the frequency of somatic single-nucleotide variations increases with replication time during the S phase much more drastically than germ-line single-nucleotide variations and somatic large-scale structural alterations, including amplifications and deletions. The ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous single-nucleotide variations is higher for cancer cells than for germ-line cells, suggesting weaker purifying selection against somatic mutations. Among genes with recurrent mutations only cancer driver genes show evidence of strong positive selection, and late-replicating regions are depleted of cancer driver genes, although enriched for recurrently mutated genes. These observations show that replication timing has a prominent role in shaping the single-nucleotide variation landscape of cancer cells.

	abstract = {Many tumors down-regulate major histocompatibility complex ({MHC)} antigen expression to evade host immune surveillance. However, there are very few in vivo models to study {MHC} antigen expression during tumor spontaneous regression. In addition, the roles of transforming growth factor betal ({TGF-beta1)}, interferon gamma ({IFN-gamma)}, and interleukin ({IL)-6} in modulating {MHC} antigen expression are ill understood. We previously reported that tumor infiltrating lymphocyte ({TIL)-derived} {IL-6} inhibits {TGF-beta1} and restores natural killing ({NK)} activity. Using an in vivo canine-transmissible venereal tumor ({CTVT)} tumor model, we presently assessed {IL-6} and {TGF-beta} involvement associated with the {MHC} antigen expression that is commonly suppressed in cancers. {IL-6}, {IFN-gamma}, and {TGF-beta1}, closely interacted with each other and modulated {MHC} antigen expression. In the presence of tumor-derived {TGF-beta1}, host {IFN-gamma} from {TIL} was not active and, therefore, there was low expression of {MHC} antigen during tumor progression. {TGF-beta1-neutralizing} antibody restored {IFN-gamma-activated} {MHC} antigen expression on tumor cells. The addition of exogenous {IL-6} that has potent anti-{TGF-beta1} activity restored {IFN-gamma} activity and promoted {MHC} antigen expression. {IFN-gamma} and {IL-6} in combination acted synergistically to enhance the expression of {MHC} antigen. Thus, the three cytokines, {IL-6}, {TGF-beta1}, and {IFN-gamma}, closely interacted to modulate the {MHC} antigen expression. Furthermore, transcription factors, including {STAT-1}, {STAT-3}, {IRF-1}, {NF-kappaB}, and {CREB}, were significantly elevated after {IL-6} and {IFN-gamma} treatment. We conclude that the host {IL-6} derived from {TIL} works in combination with host {IFN-gamma} to enhance {MHC} molecule expression formerly inhibited by {TGF-beta1}, driving the tumor toward regression. It is suggested that the treatment of cancer cells that constitutively secrete {TGF-beta1} should incorporate anti-{TGF-beta} activity. The findings in this in vivo tumor regression model have potential applications in cancer immunotherapy.},

A {CGH} profile can be viewed as a succession of segments that represent homogeneous regions in the genome whose representative sequences share the same relative copy number on average. Segmentation methods constitute a natural framework for the analysis, but they do not provide a biological status for the detected segments. We propose a new model for this segmentation/clustering problem, combining a segmentation model with a mixture model. We present a new hybrid algorithm called dynamic programming–expectation maximization ({DP–EM)} to estimate the parameters of the model by maximum likelihood. This algorithm combines {DP} and the {EM} algorithm. We also propose a model selection heuristic to select the number of clusters and the number of segments. An example of our procedure is presented, based on publicly available data sets. We compare our method to segmentation methods and to hidden Markov models, and we show that the new segmentation/clustering model is a promising alternative that can be applied in the more general context of signal processing.},

Heat shock protein 70 ({HSP70)} is over-expressed in various kinds of tumors and is believed to be involved in tumor progression. This study tested a xenogeneic chicken {HSP70} ({chHSP70)} {DNA} vaccine in an experimental canine transmissible venereal tumor ({CTVT)} model. Three vaccination strategies were compared: the first ({PE)} was designed to evaluate the prophylactic efficacy of {chHSP70} {DNA} vaccination by delivering the vaccine before tumor inoculation in a prime boost setting, the second (T) was designed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of the same prime boost vaccine by vaccinating the dogs after tumor inoculation; the third ({PT)} was similar to the first strategy ({PE)}, with the exception that the electroporation booster injection was replaced with a transdermal needle-free injection. Tumor growth was notably inhibited only in the {PE} dogs, in which the vaccination program triggered tumor regression significantly sooner than in control dogs ({NT).} The {CD4(+)} subpopulation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and canine {HSP70} ({caHSP70)-specific} {IFN-γ-secreting} lymphocytes were significantly increased during tumor regression in the {PE} dogs as compared to control dogs, demonstrating that specific tolerance to {caHSP70} has been overcome. In contrast, no benefit of the therapeutic strategy (T) could be noticed and the ({PT)} strategy only led to partial control of tumor growth. In summary, antitumor prophylactic activity was demonstrated using the {chHSP70} {DNA} vaccine including a boost via electroporation. Our data stressed the importance of {DNA} electroporation as a booster to get the full benefit of {DNA} vaccination but also of cancer immunotherapy initiation as early as possible. Xenogeneic {chHSP70} {DNA} vaccination including an electroporation boost is a potential vaccine to {HSP70-expressing} tumors, although further research is still required to better understand true clinical potential.},

	abstract = {Summary
Cancer evolves dynamically as clonal expansions supersede one another driven by shifting selective pressures, mutational processes, and disrupted cancer genes. These processes mark the genome, such that a cancer's life history is encrypted in the somatic mutations present. We developed algorithms to decipher this narrative and applied them to 21 breast cancers. Mutational processes evolve across a cancer's lifespan, with many emerging late but contributing extensive genetic variation. Subclonal diversification is prominent, and most mutations are found in just a fraction of tumor cells. Every tumor has a dominant subclonal lineage, representing more than 50\% of tumor cells. Minimal expansion of these subclones occurs until many hundreds to thousands of mutations have accumulated, implying the existence of long-lived, quiescent cell lineages capable of substantial proliferation upon acquisition of enabling genomic changes. Expansion of the dominant subclone to an appreciable mass may therefore represent the final rate-limiting step in a breast cancer's development, triggering diagnosis.

The process of carcinogenesis requires genetic instability and highly selective local microenvironments, the combination of which promotes somatic evolution. These microenvironmental forces, specifically hypoxia, acidosis and reactive oxygen species, are not only highly selective, but are also able to induce genetic instability. As a result, malignant cancers are dynamically evolving clades of cells living in distinct microhabitats that almost certainly ensure the emergence of therapy-resistant populations. Cytotoxic cancer therapies also impose intense evolutionary selection pressures on the surviving cells and thus increase the evolutionary rate. Importantly, the principles of Darwinian dynamics also embody fundamental principles that can illuminate strategies for the successful management of cancer.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled a comprehensive dissection of the cancer genome clarifying a large number of somatic mutations in a wide variety of cancer types. A number of methods have been proposed for mutation calling based on a large amount of sequencing data, which is accomplished in most cases by statistically evaluating the difference in the observed allele frequencies of possible single nucleotide variants between tumours and paired normal samples. However, an accurate detection of mutations remains a challenge under low sequencing depths or tumour contents. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel method, Empirical Bayesian mutation Calling ({https://github.com/friend1ws/EBCall)}, for detecting somatic mutations. Unlike previous methods, the proposed method discriminates somatic mutations from sequencing errors based on an empirical Bayesian framework, where the model parameters are estimated using sequencing data from multiple non-paired normal samples. Using 13 whole-exome sequencing data with 87.5–206.3 mean sequencing depths, we demonstrate that our method not only outperforms several existing methods in the calling of mutations with moderate allele frequencies but also enables accurate calling of mutations with low allele frequencies (≤10\%) harboured within a minor tumour subpopulation, thus allowing for the deciphering of fine substructures within a tumour specimen.},

	abstract = {Many tumors evade host immunity by lowering expression of major histocompatibility complex ({MHC)} molecules. Theoretically, low {MHC} expression should activate natural killer ({NK)} cells and in some cases suppress tumor growth; nevertheless, some tumors also produce high concentrations of immunosuppressive cytokines, such as transforming growth factor ({TGF)-beta}, to inhibit the activity of {NK} cells. Using a canine transmissible venereal tumor ({CTVT)} model, we have previously demonstrated that {IL-6} is a strong antagonist for {TGF-beta.} Herein, we found that {IL-6} alone was unable to significantly promote {TGF-beta-inhibited} {NK} activities. Conversely, {IL-15} alone strongly promoted {NK} activities; however, {NK} activities were inhibited to baseline levels following the addition of {TGF-beta.} Therefore, a new strategy using combined immunogene therapy of both {IL-6} and {IL-15} mediated by electroporation was used in this study. This combined {IL-6} and {IL-15} treatment effectively relieved the inhibitory effect of {TGF-beta} and activated {NK} cell cytotoxicity of lymphokine-activated killer ({LAK)} cells. Similarly, in isolated {DX5+} {NK} cells, only {IL-6} and {IL-15} in combination significantly overcame the inhibitory effect of {TGF-beta} and promoted {NK} cytotoxicity. The group of {BALB/c} mice injected with plasmids with {IL-6} and {IL-15} genes ({pIL-6/pIL-15)} had the highest percentages of {DX5+} {NK} cells as compared with either the {pIL-6} or {pIL-15} groups. Further, in {SCID} mice inoculated with {CTVT}, electroporation-mediated delivery of {pIL-6/pIL-15} was significantly more efficient in suppressing both tumor establishment and tumor growth as compared with {pIL-6} or {pIL-15} inoculation alone. In addition, the anti-asialo {GM-1} antibody abolished {NK} activities in {SCID} mice and resulted in outgrowth of the tumors. Together, these results suggest that the {TGF-beta-associated} inhibition of {NK} cytotoxicity cannot be adequately restored by simply antagonizing {TGF-beta} with {IL-6:} the co-existence of {NK} activating factors such as {IL-15} is also important in restoring {TGF-beta-inhibited} cytotoxicity. This study highlights the therapeutic potential of the {pIL-6/pIL-15} combination by inhibiting {TGF-beta} activity and enhancing {NK} cytotoxicity.},

Therefore, within-cell selection can favour {mtDNA} variants with a replication or survival advantage even if deleterious for the cell. Here, we consider how the balance between selection within and among cells is shifted in cancer cell lineages, and how this affects the somatic evolution of mitochondria. Cancer cell lineages are known to be prone to mitochondrial genetic erosion. Nevertheless, some cancer lineages are long lived and a few exceptional lineages even can survive their host because of horizontal transmission to other individuals. Recent work now shows that such transmissible cancer cell lineages occasionally secondarily recruit the mitochondrial genome of their host, which we propose as a means to replace genetically eroded mitochondrial genomes. Studying the dynamics of the horizontal exchange of {mtDNA} between somatic cells may provide important insight into the evolution of mitochondria during somatic growth and in mitochondrial diseases.},

There is a vast difference in prognosis between these two conditions. {DFTD} is often fatal within 6 months, whereas most cases of {CTVT} are eventually rejected by the host dog, who then is conferred lifelong immunity. In man, only scattered case reports exist about such communicable cancers, most often in the setting of organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplants and cancers arising during pregnancy that are transmitted to the fetus. In about one third of cases, transplant recipients develop cancers from donor organs from individuals who were found to harbor malignancies after the transplantation. The fact that two thirds of the time cancer does not develop, along with the fact that cancer very rarely is transmitted from person to person, supports the notion that natural immunity prevents such cancers from taking hold in man. These observations might hold invaluable clues to the immunobiology and possible immunotherapy of cancer.},

	abstract = {Author Summary The world's largest carnivorous marsupial, the Tasmanian devil, is threatened with extinction due to the emergence of devil facial tumour disease ({DFTD)}, a fatal transmissible tumour. Critical loss of genetic diversity has rendered the devil vulnerable to transmission of tumour cells by grafting or transplanting the cells while biting and jaw wrestling. Initial studies of {DFTD} tumours revealed rearrangements among tumour chromosomes, with several missing chromosomes and four additional marker chromosomes of unknown origin. Since then, new strains of the disease have emerged and appear to be derived from the original strain. With no prior information available regarding the location of genes on normal devil chromosomes, a necessary first step towards characterisation of chromosome rearrangements in {DFTD} was to construct a map of the normal devil genome. This enabled us to elucidate the chromosome rearrangements in three {DFTD} strains. In doing so we determined the origin of the marker chromosomes and compared the three strains to determine which areas of the genome are involved in ongoing tumour evolution. Interestingly, rearrangements between strains are limited to particular genomic regions, demonstrating the unusual stability of this unique cancer. This study is therefore an important first step towards understanding the genetics of {DFTD.}},

	abstract = {One in six cancers in humans has a viral etiology, and viruses are also a major contributor to cancer incidence in some animal species. Therefore, vaccines that control or reduce oncogenic virus infection promise to significantly reduce the overall global cancer burden. Moreover, investigation of the pathogenesis and transmission of cancer-associated viruses has provided profound insights into the molecular biology of cancer more generally. The transmission routes of oncogenic viruses are complex and varied, including horizontal and vertical transmission, and in the case of retroviruses, the generation of recombinant, transforming viruses between infectious and endogenous elements. Several puzzles remain: for instance, why certain human viruses with high oncogenic potential in experimental animals are not associated with cancer in their natural host, such as {BK} virus and adenoviruses? Most kinds of viral tumors only appear after long incubation periods (e.g., Kaposi’s sarcoma) or after exposure to other predisposing cofactors (e.g., Burkitt’s lymphoma), indicating that the virus is a necessary but not sufficient agent of tumorigenesis. Thus, the majority of individuals carry lifelong infections without ill effects, and the cancers may be regarded as occasional “side effects” of much more frequent virus infection and transmission.},

The progression of this tumour is unique in that, it follows a predictable growth pattern. In natural and experimental cases, the growth pattern includes progressive growth phase, static phase and regression phase, and this is followed by transplantation immunity in immunocompetent adults, while metastasis occurs in puppies and immunosuppressed dogs. Because of the uniqueness of {CTVT} transmission and progression, experimental investigations of various aspects of the biology of {CTVT} have been used to provide clues to the immunobiology of both animal and human tumours. This review examines the current state of knowledge of the aspects of the cytogenetic origin, immunophenotype, immunobiology and immunotherapy of {CTVT.}},

	abstract = {Canine transmissible venereal tumor ({CTVT)} is a unique tumor that can be transplanted across the major histocompatibility complex ({MHC)} barrier by viable tumor cells. In dogs, {CTVT} grows progressively for a few months and then usually regresses spontaneously. A long interspersed nuclear element ({LINE)} insertion is found specifically and constantly in the 5' end of the {CTVT} cell c-myc gene, outside the first exon. The rearranged {LINE-c-myc} gene sequence has been used with polymerase chain reaction ({PCR)} to diagnose {CTVT.} However, in {CTVT} cells, the total length of the inserted {LINE} gene is not constant. In this experiment, variation in the inserted {LINE} gene was studied to determine which parts of the {LINE} sequence can be used as primers to identify {CTVT} cells with in situ {PCR} ({IS} {PCR).} The {LINE} gene was inserted between the {TATA} boxes in the promoter region of c-myc. In {CTVT} cells, deletions of different lengths are frequent in this gene. However, the 550-bp segment at the 5' end of the {LINE-c-myc} gene was stable. Thus, primers were designed to cover the stable 0.55-kb segment from the 5' end outside the first exon of the c-myc gene to the 5' end of {LINE} gene stable segment. With these primers and {IS} {PCR}, individual {CTVT} cells in formalin-fixed tissue sections and {CTVT} cultures were identified. Cells from other canine tumors were negative for this gene. In addition, the {CTVT-specific}, 0.55-kb segment was not found in any spindle-shaped cells from progressive or regressive phase {CTVT.} The {IS} {PCR} technique also did not detect any positive spindle-shaped cells in {CTVT} cell cultures. Thus, fibroblastic terminal differentiation is less likely to be a mechanism for spontaneous regression of {CTVT} cells.},

Canine transmissible venereal tumor ({CTVT)}, a unique and spontaneous cancer transmitted by means of viable tumor cells. {CTVT} causes manifold damage to monocyte-derived {DCs.} This cancer provides an in vivo model of cancer to study the role of monocyte-derived {DCs} during spontaneous regression. Using flow cytometry and real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions, we compared the expression of surface molecules on monocyte-derived {DCs} between normal dogs and dogs with {CTVT.} These markers were {CD1a}, {CD83}, costimulatory factors ({CD40}, {CD80}, and {CD86)}, and major histocompatability complex classes I and {II.} In immature {DCs} ({iDCs)} and lipopolysaccharide-treated mature {DCs} ({mDCs)}, the surface markers were mostly downregulated during tumoral progression and regression. The tumor lowered endocytic activity of {iDCs}, as reflected in dextran uptake, and decreased allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reactions of {mDCs.} In addition, it decreased the number of monocytes in the peripheral blood by 40\%. The tumor substantially impaired the efficiency with which {DCs} were generated from monocytes and with which {mDCs} were generated from {iDCs.} We also found that progression-phase {CTVT} supernatants that were cultured for 48 h and that contained protein components killed both monocytes and {DCs.} Additionally, {DC} numbers were significantly lower in the draining lymph nodes in {CTVT} dogs than in normal dogs. In conclusion, {CTVT} caused devastating damage to monocyte-derived {DCs;} this might be one of its mechanisms for evading host immunity. Reestablishment of monocyte-derived {DC} activity by the host potentially might contribute to spontaneous tumoral regression. These findings provide insight into the extent of tumoral effects on host immune systems and responses. This information is useful for developing cancer immunotherapies.},

Procedures addressing different hypotheses are available, such as all pairwise comparisons or comparisons to control, comparison with average, or different tests for order-restricted alternatives. However, if the distribution of the response is not Gaussian, corresponding methods are usually not available or not implemented in software. For the case of comparisons among several binomial proportions, we extended recently proposed confidence interval methods for the difference of two proportions or single contrasts to multiple contrasts by using quantiles of the multivariate normal distribution, taking the correlation into account. The small sample performance of the proposed methods was investigated in simulation studies. The simple adjustment of adding 2 pseudo-observations to each sample estimate leads to reasonable coverage probabilities. The methods are illustrated by the evaluation of real data examples of a clinical trial and a toxicological study. The proposed methods and examples are available in the R package {MCPAN.} (© 2008 {WILEY-VCH} Verlag {GmbH} \& Co. {KGaA}, Weinheim)},

	abstract = {Gene expression experiments are common in molecular biology, for example in order to identify genes which play a certain role in a specified biological framework. For that purpose expression levels of several thousand genes are measured simultaneously using {DNA} microarrays. Comparing two distinct groups of tissue samples to detect those genes which are differentially expressed one statistical test per gene is performed, and resulting p-values are adjusted to control the false discovery rate. In addition, the expression change of each gene is quantified by some effect measure, typically the log fold change. In certain cases, however, a gene with a significant p-value can have a rather small fold change while in other cases a non-significant gene can have a rather large fold change. The biological relevance of the change of gene expression can be more intuitively judged by a fold change then merely by a p-value. Therefore, confidence intervals for the log fold change which accompany the adjusted p-values are desirable.

	abstract = {Cancer evolves through the accumulation of mutations, but the order in which mutations occur is poorly understood. Inference of a temporal ordering on the level of genes is challenging because clinically and histologically identical tumors often have few mutated genes in common. This heterogeneity may at least in part be due to mutations in different genes having similar phenotypic effects by acting in the same functional pathway. We estimate the constraints on the order in which alterations accumulate during cancer progression from cross-sectional mutation data using a probabilistic graphical model termed Hidden Conjunctive Bayesian Network (H-{CBN).} The possible orders are analyzed on the level of genes and, after mapping genes to functional pathways, also on the pathway level. We find stronger evidence for pathway order constraints than for gene order constraints, indicating that temporal ordering results from selective pressure acting at the pathway level. The accumulation of changes in core pathways differs among cancer types, yet a common feature is that progression appears to begin with mutations in genes that regulate apoptosis pathways and to conclude with mutations in genes involved in invasion pathways. H-{CBN} models provide a quantitative and intuitive model of tumorigenesis showing that the genetic events can be linked to the phenotypic progression on the level of pathways.},

To understand the effect of a variable of interest, such as the genotype of a locus, it is important to account for variation that is due to confounding causes. Here, we present {VBQTL}, a probabilistic approach for mapping expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTLs)} that jointly models contributions from genotype as well as known and hidden confounding factors. {VBQTL} is implemented within an efficient and flexible inference framework, making it fast and tractable on large-scale problems. We compare the performance of {VBQTL} with alternative methods for dealing with confounding variability on {eQTL} mapping datasets from simulations, yeast, mouse, and human. Employing Bayesian complexity control and joint modelling is shown to result in more precise estimates of the contribution of different confounding factors resulting in additional associations to measured transcript levels compared to alternative approaches. We present a threefold larger collection of cis {eQTLs} than previously found in a whole-genome {eQTL} scan of an outbred human population. Altogether, 27\% of the tested probes show a significant genetic association in cis, and we validate that the additional {eQTLs} are likely to be real by replicating them in different sets of individuals. Our method is the next step in the analysis of high-dimensional phenotype data, and its application has revealed insights into genetic regulation of gene expression by demonstrating more abundant cis-acting {eQTLs} in human than previously shown.

	abstract = {{IL-6} is a multifunctional cytokine that regulates cell growth, differentiation, and cell survival. Many tumor cells produce {TGF-beta1}, which allows them to evade {CTL-mediated} immune responses. {IL-6} antagonizes {TGF-beta1} inhibition of {CD3} cell activation. However, whether {IL-6} restores {NK} activity, which also is suppressed by {TGF-beta1}, is not known. We used canine transmissible venereal tumor ({CTVT)}, which produces {TGF-beta1}, as a model to determine whether {IL-6} restores lymphokine-activated killer ({LAK)} activity. During the progression phase, {CTVT} cells stop expressing {MHC} molecules. During the regression phase, the number of surface {MHC} molecules increases dramatically on about one-third of tumor cells. Tumor cells that stop expressing {MHC} should be targeted by {NK} cells. In this study, we found that {TGF-beta1} secreted by {CTVT} cells suppressed {LAK} cytotoxicity. Interestingly, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes ({TIL)} isolated from regressing {CTVT} secrete high concentrations of {IL-6} and antagonize the anti-{LAK} activity of tumor cell {TGF-beta1.} {TIL} also produce {IL-6} during progression phase, but the concentration is too low to block the anti-{LAK} activity of {TGF-beta1.} There is probably a threshold concentration of {IL-6} needed to reverse {TGF-beta1-inhibited} {LAK} activity. In addition, in the absence of {TGF-beta1}, {IL-6} derived from {TIL} does not promote the activity of {LAK.} This new mechanism, in which {TIL} manufacture high concentrations of {IL-6} to block tumor {TGF-beta1} anti-{LAK} activity, has potential applications in cancer immunotherapy and tumor prognosis.},

	abstract = {Canine transmissible venereal tumor ({CTVT)} can be allo-transplanted across major histocompatibility complex barriers. The expression of {MHC} molecules is usually low in the progression (P) stage and then greatly increases during tumor regression (R). We investigated the effects of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ({TIL)} on the expression of {MHC} molecules of {CTVT} cells. Isolated, viable {CTVT} cells were inoculated at each of 12 sites (1 x 10(8) {CTVT} cells per site) on the back of six, mixed-breed dogs. Tumor masses were collected every 2-3 weeks and prepared for histopathologic, immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry and immunoblotting studies. The level of {MHC} expression on tumor cells from different stages of growth was measured. Initially, expression of {MHC} I and {II} molecules in P phase {CTVT} was low. Twelve weeks post-inoculation ({PI)}, expression increased dramatically and it continued to increase during R phase. Tumor growth slowed after 12 weeks {PI} and tumors entered R phase around 17 weeks {PI.} We hypothesize that {CTVT} evades host immunosurveillance and grows progressively for 12 weeks, when it becomes vulnerable and subject to the host's anti-tumor immune responses. We further demonstrated that R phase, but not P phase, {TIL} were closely associated with the over-expression of {MHC} I and {II} molecules by {CTVT} cells. The number and proportion of {TIL} were higher in R phase tumors. Supernatants, from R phase co-cultures ({CTVT+TIL)} and {TIL} only, promoted {MHC} I and {II} expression on P phase {CTVT} cells. After culturing alone for 1 month, expression of {MHC} classes I and {II} molecules in R phase {CTVT} cells decreased to the level of P phase {CTVT} cells. However, the above-mentioned supernatants restored their expression of {MHC} I and {II} molecules. In contrast, supernatants from P phase {TIL} or {CTVT} cells increased expression slightly or had no effect. Therefore, {TIL}, not {CTVT} cells, produce the effective substance (s) to promote the expression of {MHC} molecules by the tumor cells. Heat treated supernatant was unable to promote the expression of {MHC} I and {II} molecules by {CTVT} cells. In conclusion, {TIL} isolated from R phase {CTVT} secreted a heat-sensitive, soluble substance(s) that triggered over-expression of {MHC} I and {II} after 12 weeks {PI.} This caused the tumor to enter R phase and helped stop {CTVT} growth. Our findings will facilitate the understanding and further investigation of the mechanisms that initiate host immune surveillance against tumors.},

	abstract = {Modern {DNA} sequencing technologies enable geneticists to rapidly identify genetic variation among many human genomes. However, isolating the minority of variants underlying disease remains an important, yet formidable challenge for medical genetics. We have developed {GEMINI} ({GEnome} {MINIng)}, a flexible software package for exploring all forms of human genetic variation. Unlike existing tools, {GEMINI} integrates genetic variation with a diverse and flexible set of genome annotations (e.g., {dbSNP}, {ENCODE}, {UCSC}, {ClinVar}, {KEGG)} into a unified database to facilitate interpretation and data exploration. Whereas other methods provide an inflexible set of variant filters or variant prioritization methods, {GEMINI} allows researchers to compose complex queries based on sample genotypes, inheritance patterns, and both pre-installed and custom genome annotations. {GEMINI} also provides methods for ad hoc queries and data exploration, a simple programming interface for custom analyses that leverage the underlying database, and both command line and graphical tools for common analyses. We demonstrate the utility of {GEMINI} for exploring variation in personal genomes and family based genetic studies, and illustrate its ability to scale to studies involving thousands of human samples. {GEMINI} is designed for reproducibility and flexibility and our goal is to will provide researchers with a standard framework for medical genomics.},

For most cancer types, this landscape consists of a small number of “mountains” (genes altered in a high percentage of tumors) and a much larger number of “hills” (genes altered infrequently). To date, these studies have revealed {\textasciitilde}140 genes that, when altered by intragenic mutations, can promote or “drive” tumorigenesis. A typical tumor contains two to eight of these “driver gene” mutations; the remaining mutations are passengers that confer no selective growth advantage. Driver genes can be classified into 12 signaling pathways that regulate three core cellular processes: cell fate, cell survival, and genome maintenance. A better understanding of these pathways is one of the most pressing needs in basic cancer research. Even now, however, our knowledge of cancer genomes is sufficient to guide the development of more effective approaches for reducing cancer morbidity and mortality.},

We performed exome and whole-genome sequencing on a series of {MGUS} (n=4), high-risk ({HR)SMM} (n=4), {MM} (n=26) and {PCL} (n=2) samples, including four cases who transformed from {HR-SMM} to {MM}, to determine the genetic factors that drive progression of disease. The pattern and number of non-synonymous mutations show that the {MGUS} disease stage is less genetically complex than {MM}, and {HR-SMM} is similar to presenting {MM.} Intraclonal heterogeneity is present at all stages and using cases of {HR-SMM}, which transformed to {MM}, we show that intraclonal heterogeneity is a typical feature of the disease. At the {HR-SMM} stage of disease, the majority of the genetic changes necessary to give rise to {MM} are already present. These data suggest that clonal progression is the key feature of transformation of {HR-SMM} to {MM} and as such the invasive clinically predominant clone typical of {MM} is already present at the {SMM} stage and would be amenable to therapeutic intervention at that stage.},

The catalogue of somatic mutations from a cancer genome bears the signatures of the mutational processes that have been operative. Here we analysed 4,938,362 mutations from 7,042 cancers and extracted more than 20 distinct mutational signatures. Some are present in many cancer types, notably a signature attributed to the {APOBEC} family of cytidine deaminases, whereas others are confined to a single cancer class. Certain signatures are associated with age of the patient at cancer diagnosis, known mutagenic exposures or defects in {DNA} maintenance, but many are of cryptic origin. In addition to these genome-wide mutational signatures, hypermutation localized to small genomic regions, ‘kataegis’, is found in many cancer types. The results reveal the diversity of mutational processes underlying the development of cancer, with potential implications for understanding of cancer aetiology, prevention and therapy.},

The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list—reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the “tumor microenvironment.” Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},

These studies involve the sequencing of matched tumour–normal samples followed by mathematical analysis to identify those genes in which mutations occur more frequently than expected by random chance. Here we describe a fundamental problem with cancer genome studies: as the sample size increases, the list of putatively significant genes produced by current analytical methods burgeons into the hundreds. The list includes many implausible genes (such as those encoding olfactory receptors and the muscle protein titin), suggesting extensive false-positive findings that overshadow true driver events. We show that this problem stems largely from mutational heterogeneity and provide a novel analytical methodology, {MutSigCV}, for resolving the problem. We apply {MutSigCV} to exome sequences from 3,083 tumour–normal pairs and discover extraordinary variation in mutation frequency and spectrum within cancer types, which sheds light on mutational processes and disease aetiology, and in mutation frequency across the genome, which is strongly correlated with {DNA} replication timing and also with transcriptional activity. By incorporating mutational heterogeneity into the analyses, {MutSigCV} is able to eliminate most of the apparent artefactual findings and enable the identification of genes truly associated with cancer.},

By “lineage retracing” using the multicolor Cre-reporter {R26R-Confetti}, we demonstrate that the crypt stem cell marker Lgr5 (leucine-rich repeat–containing heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein–coupled receptor 5) also marks a subpopulation of adenoma cells that fuel the growth of established intestinal adenomas. These Lgr5+ cells, which represent about 5 to 10\% of the cells in the adenomas, generate additional Lgr5+ cells as well as all other adenoma cell types.

	abstract = {Recurrent chromosomal translocations involving the mixed lineage leukaemia ({MLL)} gene initiate aggressive forms of leukaemia, which are often refractory to conventional therapies. Many {MLL-fusion} partners are members of the super elongation complex ({SEC)}, a critical regulator of transcriptional elongation, suggesting that aberrant control of this process has an important role in leukaemia induction. Here we use a global proteomic strategy to demonstrate that {MLL} fusions, as part of {SEC} and the polymerase-associated factor complex ({PAFc)}, are associated with the {BET} family of acetyl-lysine recognizing, chromatin /`adaptor/' proteins. These data provided the basis for therapeutic intervention in {MLL-fusion} leukaemia, via the displacement of the {BET} family of proteins from chromatin. We show that a novel small molecule inhibitor of the {BET} family, {GSK1210151A} (I-{BET151)}, has profound efficacy against human and murine {MLL-fusion} leukaemic cell lines, through the induction of early cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. I-{BET151} treatment in two human leukaemia cell lines with different {MLL} fusions alters the expression of a common set of genes whose function may account for these phenotypic changes. The mode of action of I-{BET151} is, at least in part, due to the inhibition of transcription at key genes ({BCL2}, C-{MYC} and {CDK6)} through the displacement of {BRD3/4}, {PAFc} and {SEC} components from chromatin. In vivo studies indicate that I-{BET151} has significant therapeutic value, providing survival benefit in two distinct mouse models of murine {MLL-AF9} and human {MLL-AF4} leukaemia. Finally, the efficacy of I-{BET151} against human leukaemia stem cells is demonstrated, providing further evidence of its potent therapeutic potential. These findings establish the displacement of {BET} proteins from chromatin as a promising epigenetic therapy for these aggressive leukaemias.},

	abstract = {In dogs, the canine transmissible venereal tumor ({CTVT)} is the only neoplasm which is not produced by neoplastic transformation of normal cells; the tumor is transmitted from the affected dog to healthy dogs by implantation of one or various clones of cancer cells. Thus, the {CTVT} of dogs analyzed in various countries reveals similar genetic characteristics and consequently {CTVT} is considered to have a clonal origin. The {CTVTs} obtained from dogs in Korea showed the {T963C} mutation on {TP53} gene; this mutation was thought to be a molecular alteration which participates in the origin of the ancestral clone, {CTVT.} Nonetheless, this supposed mutation has not been identified in other studies which were carried out for the purpose of clarifying the clonal origin of {CTVT.} Thus we have considered it important to identify the role of the {T963C} mutation of the {TP53} gene in the clonal origin of {CTVT} in dogs. Consequently the region which includes the mutation of the {TP53} gene in twenty samples of {CTVT} obtained from various canine breeds was {PCR} amplified and afterwards its sequence of nucleotides was determined. We conclude that this mutation did not participate in the clonal origin of the tumor, but was acquired at a later stage.},

We show that the tumour type is characterized by complex genomic alterations, with a mean of 360 exonic mutations, 165 genomic rearrangements, and 323 segments of copy number alteration per tumour. We find statistically recurrent mutations in 11 genes, including mutation of {TP53} in nearly all specimens.

Significantly altered pathways included {NFE2L2} and {KEAP1} in 34\%, squamous differentiation genes in 44\%, phosphatidylinositol-3-{OH} kinase pathway genes in 47\%, and {CDKN2A} and {RB1} in 72\% of tumours.

We propose two parameterizations of a Poisson mixture model to cluster expression profiles of high-throughput sequencing data. A set of simulation studies compares the performance of the proposed models with that of an approach developed for a similar type of data, namely serial analysis of gene expression. We also study the performance of these approaches on two real high-throughput sequencing data sets.

We then screened the {TERT} promoter in sporadic melanoma and observed recurrent ultraviolet signature somatic mutations in 125 of 168 (74\%) of human cell lines derived from metastatic melanomas, 45 of 53 corresponding metastatic tumor tissues (85\%), and 25 of 77 (33\%) primary melanomas.

Herein, we report on the effectiveness of gene therapy with plasmid encoding human {IL-12} ({pIL-12)} through in vivo electroporation in the treatment of beagles with a canine tumor, the canine transmissible venereal tumor ({CTVT).} The optimal electroporation conditions for gene transfer into {CTVTs} were tested by luciferase activity and determined to be a voltage of 200 V and duration of 50 msec, with the number of shocks set at 10 pulses, and the use of an electrode with 2 needles. Under these conditions, intratumoral administration of as little as 0.1 mg {pIL-12} followed by electroporation significantly inhibited the growth of well-established tumors and eventually led to complete tumor regression. Furthermore, local {pIL-12} treatment also induced a strong systemic effect that prevented new tumor growth and cured established tumors at distant locations. Intratumoral administration of {pIL-12} greatly elevated the {IL-12} level in the tumor masses, but produced only a trace amount in the serum. A high level of {IFN-gamma} {mRNA} was also detected in the treated tumor masses. {pIL-12} gene therapy attracted significantly more lymphocytes infiltrating the tumors, including {CD4(+)} and {CD8(+)} T cells, and the surface expression of {MHC} I and {MHC} {II} molecules on {CTVT} cells was greatly increased after {pIL-12} therapy. This treatment also induced apoptosis of the tumor cells as detected by Annexin V. More importantly, delivery of {pIL-12} with intratumoral electroporation did not result in any detectable toxicity in the dogs. We conclude that intratumoral electroporation of the {pIL-12} gene could cause profound immunologic host responses and efficiently treat {CTVT} in beagle dogs. The results also indicate that {CTVT} is an excellent large animal cancer model for testing immunogene therapies mediated by electroporation.},

This comprised several biological processes, including changes in the stoichiometry of electron transport-chain complexes, repressed vesicle-mediated transport during the intermediate stage, and an {EMT-like} process in the late phase. In addition, we demonstrate that the nucleoporin Nup210 is essential for reprogramming by its permitting of rapid cellular proliferation and subsequent progression through {MET.} Along with the identification of proteins expressed in a stage-specific manner, this study provides a rich resource toward an enhanced mechanistic understanding of cellular reprogramming.},

The process has parallels with paper folding sequences that arise when a piece of paper is folded several times and then unfolded. Here we adapt such methods to study the breakage-fusion-bridge structures in detail. We firstly consider discrete representations of this space with 2-d trees to demonstrate that there are 2{\textasciicircum}(n(n-1)/2) qualitatively distinct evolutions involving n breakage-fusion-bridge cycles. Secondly we consider the stochastic nature of the fold positions, to determine evolution likelihoods, and also describe how amplicons become localised. Finally we highlight these methods by inferring the evolution of breakage-fusion-bridge cycles with data from primary tissue cancer samples.},

Here we present results of the pilot phase of the project, designed to develop and compare different strategies for genome-wide sequencing with high-throughput platforms. We undertook three projects: low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 179 individuals from four populations; high-coverage sequencing of two mother–father–child trios; and exon-targeted sequencing of 697 individuals from seven populations. We describe the location, allele frequency and local haplotype structure of approximately 15 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1 million short insertions and deletions, and 20,000 structural variants, most of which were previously undescribed. We show that, because we have catalogued the vast majority of common variation, over 95\% of the currently accessible variants found in any individual are present in this data set. On average, each person is found to carry approximately 250 to 300 loss-of-function variants in annotated genes and 50 to 100 variants previously implicated in inherited disorders. We demonstrate how these results can be used to inform association and functional studies. From the two trios, we directly estimate the rate of de novo germline base substitution mutations to be approximately 10−8 per base pair per generation. We explore the data with regard to signatures of natural selection, and identify a marked reduction of genetic variation in the neighbourhood of genes, due to selection at linked sites. These methods and public data will support the next phase of human genetic research.},

	abstract = {We study trend filtering, a recently proposed tool of Kim et al. (2009) for nonparametric regression. The trend filtering estimate is defined as the minimizer of a penalized least squares criterion, in which the penalty term sums the absolute kth order discrete derivatives over the input points. Perhaps not surprisingly, trend filtering estimates appear to have the structure of kth degree spline functions, with adaptively chosen knot points (we say "appear" here as trend filtering estimates are not really functions over continuous domains, and are only defined over the discrete set of inputs). This brings to mind comparisons to other nonparametric regression tools that also produce adaptive splines; in particular, we compare trend filtering to smoothing splines, which penalize the sum of squared derivatives across input points, and to locally adaptive regression splines (Mammen \& van de Geer 1997), which penalize the total variation of the kth derivative. Empirically, we discover that trend filtering estimates adapt to the local level of smoothness much better than smoothing splines, and further, they exhibit a remarkable similarity to locally adaptive regression splines. We also provide theoretical support for these empirical findings; most notably, we prove that (with the right choice of tuning parameter) the trend filtering estimate converges to the true underlying function at the minimax rate for functions whose kth derivative is of bounded variation. This is done via an asymptotic pairing of trend filtering and locally adaptive regression splines, which have already been shown to converge at the minimax rated (Mammen \& van de Geer 1997). At the core of this argument is a new result tying together the fitted values of two lasso problems that share the same outcome vector, but have different predictor matrices.},

	abstract = {Summary
All cancers carry somatic mutations. The patterns of mutation in cancer genomes reflect the {DNA} damage and repair processes to which cancer cells and their precursors have been exposed. To explore these mechanisms further, we generated catalogs of somatic mutation from 21 breast cancers and applied mathematical methods to extract mutational signatures of the underlying processes. Multiple distinct single- and double-nucleotide substitution signatures were discernible. Cancers with {BRCA1} or {BRCA2} mutations exhibited a characteristic combination of substitution mutation signatures and a distinctive profile of deletions. Complex relationships between somatic mutation prevalence and transcription were detected. A remarkable phenomenon of localized hypermutation, termed “kataegis,” was observed. Regions of kataegis differed between cancers but usually colocalized with somatic rearrangements. Base substitutions in these regions were almost exclusively of cytosine at {TpC} dinucleotides. The mechanisms underlying most of these mutational signatures are unknown. However, a role for the {APOBEC} family of cytidine deaminases is proposed.

We used targeted hybridization-based {DNA} capture and 454 sequencing to sequence 324 {CNV} breakpoints, including 315 deletions. We observed two major breakpoint signatures: 70\% of the deletion breakpoints have 1−30 bp of microhomology, whereas 33\% of deletion breakpoints contain 1−367 bp of inserted sequence. The co-occurrence of microhomology and inserted sequence is low (10\%), suggesting that there are at least two different mutational mechanisms. Approximately 5\% of the breakpoints represent more complex rearrangements, including local microinversions, suggesting a replication-based strand switching mechanism. Despite a rich literature on {DNA} repair processes, reconstruction of the molecular events generating each of these mutations is not yet possible.},

It is shown that they can be improved upon by using noise with a continuous distribution instead, regardless of whether the randomization is determined by the data or an external source of randomness.

The technique can be applied very generally to enhance existing approaches, although we consider it in greatest detail in the context of estimating a binomial proportion or a Poisson mean, where it is particularly effective. The method is motivated by a simple theoretical result, which shows that, by splitting the original sample of size n into two parts, of sizes n1 and n2=n−n1, and basing the confidence procedure on the average of the means of these two subsamples, the highly oscillatory behaviour of coverage error, as a function of n, is largely removed. Perhaps surprisingly, this approach does not increase confidence interval width; usually the width is slightly reduced. Contrary to what might be expected, our new method performs well when it is used to modify confidence intervals based on existing techniques that already perform very well—it typically improves significantly their coverage accuracy. Each application of the split sample method to an existing confidence interval procedure results in a new technique.},

We sequenced the genomes of two {CTVT} tumors and found that {CTVT} has acquired 1.9 million somatic substitution mutations and bears evidence of exposure to ultraviolet light. {CTVT} is remarkably stable and lacks subclonal heterogeneity despite thousands of rearrangements, copy-number changes, and retrotransposon insertions. More than 10,000 genes carry nonsynonymous variants, and 646 genes have been lost. {CTVT} first arose in a dog with low genomic heterozygosity that may have lived about 11,000 years ago. The cancer spawned by this individual dispersed across continents about 500 years ago. Our results provide a genetic identikit of an ancient dog and demonstrate the robustness of mammalian somatic cells to survive for millennia despite a massive mutation burden.
Breaking Tumor Dogma
Canine transmissible venereal tumor ({CTVT)} is an unusual form of cancer because the infectious agent is not a virus or bacterium but the tumor cells themselves, which are passed from one dog to another during coitus. To explore the molecular features of the tumor and its possible origins, Murchison et al. (p. 437; see the Perspective by Parker and Ostrander) sequenced the genomes of two {CTVTs} and their host dogs, one from Australia and one from Brazil. Although {CTVT} has acquired a massive number of genomic alterations, including hundreds of times more somatic mutations than are normally found in human cancers, the tumor cell genome has remained diploid and stable. Indeed, {CTVT} may first have arisen in a dog that lived more than 10,000 years ago.},

	abstract = {Cancer is generally defined as uncontrollable growth of cells caused by genetic aberrations and/or environmental factors. Yet contagious cancers also occur. The recent emergence of a contagious cancer in Tasmanian devils has reignited interest in transmissible cancers. Two naturally occurring transmissible cancers are known: devil facial tumour disease and canine transmissible venereal tumour. Both cancers evolved once and have then been transmitted from one individual to another as clonal cell lines. The dog cancer is ancient; having evolved more than 6,000 years ago, while the devil disease was first seen in 1996. In this review I will compare and contrast the two diseases focusing on the life histories of the clonal cell lines, their evolutionary trajectories and the mechanisms by which they have achieved immune tolerance. A greater understanding of these contagious cancers will provide unique insights into the role of the immune system in shaping tumour evolution and may uncover novel approaches for treating human cancer.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}

Minimally invasive locoregional therapies for human liver tumors have been developed in recent years, and similar treatment options may be successful in the management of human lung cancer. Our goal was to develop a lung tumor model in a large animal to simulate human lung cancer for preclinical assessment of novel therapeutic options.


{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}

Fresh canine transmissible venereal tumor ({cTVT)} fragments were inoculated into the lungs of 10 dogs by intraarterial (n = 2) or percutaneous (n = 8) methods. Cyclosporin was administered to produce immunosuppression in nine of the dogs. Tumor growth was monitored at regular intervals (every 1-2 weeks) by computed tomography. All animals were killed between 6 and 10 weeks after inoculation; complete necropsy examinations were performed and appropriate tissues were removed for gross and histopathologic evaluation.


{RESULTS}

Administration of tumor fragments into the right apical pulmonary artery resulted in the development of more than 20 well-defined scattered pulmonary nodules in the affected lung segment. Nodules grew to a maximum diameter of 12 mm in 10 weeks. Percutaneous inoculation of tumor fragments resulted in more predictable growth of solitary tumors (range, 7-35 mm in diameter) in the transplantation bed. No tumor growth was observed in the dog that did not receive cyclosporin.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Percutaneous inoculation and intraarterial transplantation of {cTVT} fragments in the canine lung result in predictable patterns of tumor growth resembling the solitary pulmonary nodules and metastatic disease found in humans. In addition, cyclosporin administration may be necessary to promote growth of viable tumor.},

In this study we assessed the presence of mast cell numbers and microvessel density during the progression and regression stages of natural spontaneous canine transmissible venereal tumours ({CTVT).} Mast cells were demonstrated by histochemical staining with toluidine blue, alcian blue and safranin O. Microvessel counts were demonstrated by immunohistochemical labelling with an antibody against the endothelial cell marker factor {VIII.} Mitotic cells, apoptotic cells and tumour infiltrating lymphocytes were counted from haematoxylin-eosin-stained sections. Tumour fibrosis was evaluated on Masson's trichome-stained sections. The results showed that progressing tumours had significantly higher mast cell counts and microvessel counts at the invasive edges of the tumours than did regressing tumours. In both the progressing and regressing tumours, microvessel counts were significantly positively correlated with mast cell counts. Regressing tumours had significantly higher mast cell counts of the whole tumour than progressing tumours. The results also showed that progressing tumours had significantly higher mitotic rate than regressing tumours, and fibrosis and apoptosis were significantly higher in regressing tumours than progressing tumours. There were no significant differences between the biochemical and haematological values of dogs with progressing and regressing tumours. These results suggests that mast cells play a role in {CTVT} progression probably by promoting vascularization at the invasion front during the progression phase, and that mast cell count could be used as one of the histological factors to indicate growth stage of {CTVT.}},

This poor prognosis is due to therapeutic resistance and tumour recurrence after surgical removal. Precisely how recurrence occurs is unknown. Using a genetically engineered mouse model of glioma, here we identify a subset of endogenous tumour cells that are the source of new tumour cells after the drug temozolomide ({TMZ)} is administered to transiently arrest tumour growth. A nestin-{ΔTK-IRES-GFP} (Nes-{ΔTK-GFP)} transgene that labels quiescent subventricular zone adult neural stem cells also labels a subset of endogenous glioma tumour cells. On arrest of tumour cell proliferation with {TMZ}, pulse-chase experiments demonstrate a tumour re-growth cell hierarchy originating with the Nes-{ΔTK-GFP} transgene subpopulation. Ablation of the {GFP+} cells with chronic ganciclovir administration significantly arrested tumour growth, and combined {TMZ} and ganciclovir treatment impeded tumour development. Thus, a relatively quiescent subset of endogenous glioma cells, with properties similar to those proposed for cancer stem cells, is responsible for sustaining long-term tumour growth through the production of transient populations of highly proliferative cells.},

One hundred dogs with {CTVT} entered this prospective study. The animals were treated with vincristine sulfate (0.025 mg/kg) at weekly intervals until the tumor had macroscopically disappeared. The time to complete remission was recorded. A multivariate Cox regression model indicated that larger tumor mass, increased age and therapy during hot and rainy months were independent significant unfavorable predictive factors retarding remission, whereas sex, weight, status as owned dog or breed were of no predictive relevance. Further studies are necessary to investigate whether these results are due to changes in immunological response mechanisms in animals with a diminished immune surveillance, resulting in delays in tumor regression.},

	abstract = {In recent years, advances in high throughput sequencing technology have led to a need for specialized methods for the analysis of digital gene expression data. While gene expression data measured on a microarray take on continuous values and can be modeled using the normal distribution, {RNA} sequencing data involve nonnegative counts and are more appropriately modeled using a discrete count distribution, such as the Poisson or the negative binomial. Consequently, analytic tools that assume a Gaussian distribution (such as classification methods based on linear discriminant analysis and clustering methods that use Euclidean distance) may not perform as well for sequencing data as methods that are based upon a more appropriate distribution. Here, we propose new approaches for performing classification and clustering of observations on the basis of sequencing data. Using a Poisson log linear model, we develop an analog of diagonal linear discriminant analysis that is appropriate for sequencing data. We also propose an approach for clustering sequencing data using a new dissimilarity measure that is based upon the Poisson model. We demonstrate the performances of these approaches in a simulation study, on three publicly available {RNA} sequencing data sets, and on a publicly available chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data set.},

The {PI(3)K/AKT} pathway was recurrently mutated, suggesting this pathway as a potential therapeutic target.

Aggressive cancers demonstrated evidence of a metabolic shift, involving downregulation of genes involved in the {TCA} cycle, decreased {AMPK} and {PTEN} protein levels, upregulation of the pentose phosphate pathway and the glutamine transporter genes, increased acetyl-{CoA} carboxylase protein, and altered promoter methylation of {miR-21} (also known as {MIR21)} and {GRB10.} Remodelling cellular metabolism thus constitutes a recurrent pattern in {ccRCC} that correlates with tumour stage and severity and offers new views on the opportunities for disease treatment.},

In some cases, the evolutionary history and population frequency of the subclonal lineages of tumor cells present in the sample can be reconstructed from these {SNV} frequency measurements. However, automated methods to do this reconstruction are not available and the conditions under which reconstruction is possible have not been described. We describe the conditions under which the evolutionary history can be uniquely reconstructed from {SNV} frequencies from single or multiple samples from the tumor population and we introduce a new statistical model, {PhyloSub}, that infers the phylogeny and genotype of the major subclonal lineages represented in the population of cancer cells. It uses a Bayesian nonparametric prior over trees that groups {SNVs} into major subclonal lineages and automatically estimates the number of lineages and their ancestry. We sample from the joint posterior distribution over trees to identify evolutionary histories and cell population frequencies that have the highest probability of generating the observed {SNV} frequency data. When multiple phylogenies are consistent with a given set of {SNV} frequencies, {PhyloSub} represents the uncertainty in the tumor phylogeny using a partial order plot. Experiments on a simulated dataset and two real datasets comprising tumor samples from acute myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients demonstrate that {PhyloSub} can infer both linear (or chain) and branching lineages and its inferences are in good agreement with ground truth, where it is available.},

Probabilistic assumptions for the distribution of the data, i.e. for the observed positions of the mapped reads, as well as for systematic errors, i.e. for reads which map closely but not exactly to a real {TSS}, are made and can be adapted by the user. The framework also comprises a regularization procedure which can be applied as a preprocessing step to decrease the noise and thereby reduce the number of false predictions.

	abstract = {Human cancer is caused by the accumulation of genetic alterations in cells. Of special importance are changes that occur early during malignant transformation because they may result in oncogene addiction and represent promising targets for therapeutic intervention. Here we describe a computational approach, called Retracing the Evolutionary Steps in Cancer ({RESIC)}, to deduce the temporal sequence of genetic events during tumorigenesis from cross-sectional genomic data of tumors at their fully transformed stage. When applied to a dataset of 70 advanced colorectal cancers, our algorithm accurately predicts the sequence of {APC}, {KRAS}, and {TP53} mutations previously defined by analyzing tumors at different stages of colon cancer formation. We further validate the method with glioblastoma and leukemia sample data and then apply it to complex integrated genomics databases, finding that high-level {EGFR} amplification appears to be a late event in primary glioblastomas. {RESIC} represents the first evolutionary mathematical approach to identify the temporal sequence of mutations driving tumorigenesis and may be useful to guide the validation of candidate genes emerging from cancer genome surveys.},

Canine transmissible venereal tumor ({CTVT)}, a unique and spontaneous cancer transmitted by means of viable tumor cells. {CTVT} causes manifold damage to monocyte-derived {DCs.} This cancer provides an in vivo model of cancer to study the role of monocyte-derived {DCs} during spontaneous regression. Using flow cytometry and real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions, we compared the expression of surface molecules on monocyte-derived {DCs} between normal dogs and dogs with {CTVT.} These markers were {CD1a}, {CD83}, costimulatory factors ({CD40}, {CD80}, and {CD86)}, and major histocompatability complex classes I and {II.} In immature {DCs} ({iDCs)} and lipopolysaccharide-treated mature {DCs} ({mDCs)}, the surface markers were mostly downregulated during tumoral progression and regression. The tumor lowered endocytic activity of {iDCs}, as reflected in dextran uptake, and decreased allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reactions of {mDCs.} In addition, it decreased the number of monocytes in the peripheral blood by 40\%. The tumor substantially impaired the efficiency with which {DCs} were generated from monocytes and with which {mDCs} were generated from {iDCs.} We also found that progression-phase {CTVT} supernatants that were cultured for 48 h and that contained protein components killed both monocytes and {DCs.} Additionally, {DC} numbers were significantly lower in the draining lymph nodes in {CTVT} dogs than in normal dogs. In conclusion, {CTVT} caused devastating damage to monocyte-derived {DCs;} this might be one of its mechanisms for evading host immunity. Reestablishment of monocyte-derived {DC} activity by the host potentially might contribute to spontaneous tumoral regression. These findings provide insight into the extent of tumoral effects on host immune systems and responses. This information is useful for developing cancer immunotherapies.},

Sequencing generates counts of the number of times each base was observed at hundreds of thousands to billions of genome positions in each sample. Using these counts to detect mutations is challenging because mutations may have very low prevalence and sequencing error rates vary dramatically by genome position. The discreteness of sequencing data also creates a difficult multiple testing problem: current false discovery rate methods are designed for continuous data, and work poorly, if at all, on discrete data. We show that a simple randomization technique lets us use continuous false discovery rate methods on discrete data. Our approach is a useful way to estimate false discovery rates for any collection of discrete test statistics, and is hence not limited to sequencing data. We then use an empirical Bayes model to capture different sources of variation in sequencing error rates. The resulting method outperforms existing detection approaches on example data sets.},

Detailed analysis of the reads from amplified libraries revealed characteristics suggesting that majority of amplified fragment ends are identical but inverted versions of each other. Read coverage in amplified libraries is correlated with both tandem and inverted repeat content, while {GC} content only influences sequencing in long-insert libraries. Nevertheless, single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP)} calls and assembly metrics from reads in amplified libraries show comparable results with unamplified libraries.

After a short stable phase, the tumor undergoes regression (R phase). In this study, {CTVT} inoculation significantly reduced the proportion of B lymphocytes among all peripheral blood lymphocytes ({PBL)}, but the proportion of B lymphocytes returned to normal after complete removal of {CTVT.} Following {CTVT} inoculation, immunoglobulin concentrations decreased gradually, coincident with B lymphocyte decline. Furthermore, {CTVT} secreted a soluble, heat- and protease K-sensitive cytotoxic molecule(s) that destroyed peripheral blood B lymphocytes ({PBBL)} but spared other types of immune cells regardless of whether mitogens, such as {IL-2} or Con A, were present. The decrease in the proportion and viability of {PBBL} was caused by a cytotoxic molecule(s) that induced apoptosis.

Removing duplicate reads assumes that polymerase chain reaction amplification from library constructions is the primary source. The alternative—sampling coincidence from {DNA} fragmentation—has not been systematically investigated.
Results: With sufficiently high-sequencing depth, sampling-induced read duplication is non-negligible, and removing duplicate reads can overcorrect read counts, causing systemic biases in variant allele fraction and copy number variation estimations. Minimal overcorrection occurs when duplicate reads are identified accounting for their mate reads, inserts are of a variety of lengths and samples are sequenced in separate batches. We investigate sampling-induced read duplication in deep sequencing data with 500× to 2000× duplicates-removed sequence coverage. We provide a quantitative solution to overcorrection and guidance for effective designs of deep sequencing platforms that facilitate accurate estimation of variant allele fraction and copy number variation.

Remarkably, these mutational processes are poorly characterized. Global sequencing initiatives are yielding catalogs of somatic mutations from thousands of cancers, thus providing the unique opportunity to decipher the signatures of mutational processes operative in human cancer. However, until now there have been no theoretical models describing the signatures of mutational processes operative in cancer genomes and no systematic computational approaches are available to decipher these mutational signatures. Here, by modeling mutational processes as a blind source separation problem, we introduce a computational framework that effectively addresses these questions. Our approach provides a basis for characterizing mutational signatures from cancer-derived somatic mutational catalogs, paving the way to insights into the pathogenetic mechanism underlying all cancers.},

However, an associated {SNP} is likely part of a larger region of linkage disequilibrium. This makes it difficult to precisely identify the {SNPs} that have a biological link with the phenotype. We have systematically investigated the association of multiple types of {ENCODE} data with disease-associated {SNPs} and show that there is significant enrichment for functional {SNPs} among the currently identified associations. This enrichment is strongest when integrating multiple sources of functional information and when highest confidence disease-associated {SNPs} are used. We propose an approach that integrates multiple types of functional data generated by the {ENCODE} Consortium to help identify "functional {SNPs"} that may be associated with the disease phenotype. Our approach generates putative functional annotations for up to 80\% of all previously reported associations. We show that for most associations, the functional {SNP} most strongly supported by experimental evidence is a {SNP} in linkage disequilibrium with the reported association rather than the reported {SNP} itself. Our results show that the experimental data sets generated by the {ENCODE} Consortium can be successfully used to suggest functional hypotheses for variants associated with diseases and other phenotypes.},

	abstract = {Canine transmissible venereal tumor ({CTVT)} is an intriguing cancer that is transmitted naturally as an allograft by transplantation of viable tumor cells from affected to susceptible dogs. At least initially, the tumor is able to evade the host's immune response; thus, {CTVT} has potential to provide novel insights into tumor immunobiology. The nature of {CTVT} as a "contagious" cancer, originating from a common ancestral source of infection, has been demonstrated previously by a series of studies comparing geographically distinct tumors at the molecular level. While these studies have revealed that apparently unrelated tumors share a striking degree of karyotypic conservation, technological restraints have limited the ability to investigate the chromosome composition of {CTVTs} in any detail. We present characterization of a strategically selected panel of {CTVT} cases using microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis at {\textasciitilde}one-megabase resolution. These data show for the first time that the tumor presents with an extensive range of non-random chromosome copy number aberrations that are distributed widely throughout the dog genome. The majority of abnormalities detected were imbalances of small subchromosomal regions, often involving centromeric and telomeric sequences. All cases also showed the sex chromosome complement {XO.} There was remarkable conservation in the cytogenetic profiles of the tumors analyzed, with only minor variation observed between different cases. These data suggest that the {CTVT} genome demonstrates a vast degree of both structural and numerical reorganization that is maintained during transmission among the domestic dog population.},

Matching {MHC} alleles is critical for organ transplantation, while changes in the {MHC} profile of tumour cells allow effective evasion of the immune response. Two unique cancers have exploited these features to become transmissible. In this review I discuss the functional role of {MHC} molecules in the emergence and evolution of Devil Facial Tumour Disease ({DFTD)} and Canine Transmissible Venereal Tumour ({CTVT).} High levels of genetic diversity at {MHC} genes play a critical role in protecting populations of vertebrate species from contagious cancer. However, species that have undergone genetic bottlenecks and have lost diversity at {MHC} genes are at risk of transmissible tumours. Moreover, evolution and selection for tumour variants capable of evading the immune response allow contagious cancers to cross {MHC} barriers. Transmissible cancers are rare but they can provide unique insights into the genetics and immunology of tumours and organ transplants.},

Twenty dogs with naturally occurring {CTVT} in the progression stage were divided into 4 groups and treated with intratumoral {BCG}, vincristine, {BCG/vincristine} combination therapy or intratumoral buffered saline (control group). Tumour sizes were determined weekly and tumour response to therapy was assessed. Tumour biopsies were taken weekly to evaluate histological changes. Complete tumour regression was observed in all the dogs treated with {BCG}, vincristine and {BCG/vincristine} combination therapy. {BCG/vincristine} combination therapy had a statistically significantly shorter regression time than {BCG} or vincristine therapy. No tumour regression was observed in the control group. Intratumoral {BCG} treatment resulted in the appearance of macrophages and increased numbers of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes ({TILs)} followed by tumour cell apoptosis and necrosis. Treatment with vincristine resulted in increased tumour cell apoptosis, reduction in the mitotic index and a decrease in the number of {TILs.} Tumours from dogs on {BCG/vincristine} combination were characterised by reduction in the mitotic index, and appearance of numerous {TILs} and macrophages followed by marked tumour cell apoptosis and necrosis. This study indicates that combined {BCG} and vincristine therapy is more effective than vincristine in treating {CTVT}, suggesting that the clinical course of this disease may be altered by immunochemotherapy.},

Something new is happening in the twenty-first century: high-throughput devices, such as microarrays, routinely require simultaneous hypothesis tests for thousands of individual cases, not at all what the classical theory had in mind. In these situations empirical Bayes information begins to force itself upon frequentists and Bayesians alike. The two-groups model is a simple Bayesian construction that facilitates empirical Bayes analysis. This article concerns the interplay of Bayesian and frequentist ideas in the two-groups setting, with particular attention focused on Benjamini and Hochberg's False Discovery Rate method. Topics include the choice and meaning of the null hypothesis in large-scale testing situations, power considerations, the limitations of permutation methods, significance testing for groups of cases (such as pathways in microarray studies), correlation effects, multiple confidence intervals and Bayesian competitors to the two-groups model.},

We apply single-nucleus sequencing to investigate tumour population structure and evolution in two human breast cancer cases. Analysis of 100 single cells from a polygenomic tumour revealed three distinct clonal subpopulations that probably represent sequential clonal expansions. Additional analysis of 100 single cells from a monogenomic primary tumour and its liver metastasis indicated that a single clonal expansion formed the primary tumour and seeded the metastasis. In both primary tumours, we also identified an unexpectedly abundant subpopulation of genetically diverse ‘pseudodiploid’ cells that do not travel to the metastatic site. In contrast to gradual models of tumour progression, our data indicate that tumours grow by punctuated clonal expansions with few persistent intermediates.},

However, during the later stages of tumor progression, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes secrete {IL-6.} This cytokine antagonizes {TGF-beta} and restores the {IFN-gamma} activities in promoting {MHC} antigen expression, and the {NK} cytotoxicity that has been repressed by {TGF-beta} is also activated. In this study, we applied combinatory treatment of {IL-6} plasmid and {IL-15} plasmid ({pIL-6/pIL-15)} to {CTVT-bearing} beagles. {IL-6} was used as an anti-{TGF-beta} cytokine; {IL-15} was used to promote {NK-} and {CTVT-specific} cytotoxicity. After intratumoral {pIL-6/pIL-15} delivery mediated by electroporation, {MHC} antigen expression on {CTVT} cells was dramatically increased from in less than 5.9\% to up to 34\% of the tumor cells. The proportion of {CD8(+)} T cells infiltrating the tumor was also significantly elevated from 6.96+/-0.23\% to 21.63+/-5.40\%. In addition, the tumor-specific cytotoxicity was enhanced along with a marked increase in tumor-specific {IFN-gamma-producing} cells. These immune responses are believed to be the important forces driving the tumor towards regression.

	abstract = {Stromal cells and extracellular matrix ({ECM)} components are important for tumour cell behaviour. Little is known about the role of stromal cells and {ECM} components in the progression and regression of spontaneous canine transmissible venereal tumour ({CTVT).} In this study, the stromal cell type was determined by immunohistochemical labelling with antibodies to desmin, vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-{SMA)} during the progressive and regressive stages of spontaneous {CTVT.} The distribution of {ECM} components tenascin-C, chondroitin sulphate and versican were determined immunohistochemically, and hyaluronan distribution was determined using a biotinylated protein complex with specific affinity for hyaluronan. Stromal cells of tumours in both the progressive and regressive stage were positive for vimentin and negative for desmin. The number of stromal cells expressing alpha-{SMA} was significantly higher (P=0.001) in regressing tumours, than progressing tumours. These results suggest that the modulation of stromal cells that occurs during the regression of {CTVT} is similar to that occurring during wound healing. Tenascin-C was weakly expressed in the stroma of tumours in the progressive stage and in regions of the regressing tumours with tumour infiltrating lymphocytes ({TILs)}, but intensely expressed in the stroma of tumours in late regressive stage. In addition, tenascin-C was also expressed in the cytoplasm of some tumour cells in the late regressive stage. A strong stromal tenascin-C intensity was significantly associated with regressing tumours (P=0.001). Strong stromal hyaluronan intensity and a high proportion of hyaluronan-positive tumour cells were significantly associated with progressing tumours (P=0.001). This suggests that hyaluronan is involved in the growth of the tumour. There was no significant difference in the expression of chondroitin sulphate and versican in progressing and regressing tumours.},

Our probabilistic method incorporates knowledge about the distribution of variants in terms of a prior probability. We show that our algorithm has a high accuracy of calling cancer mutations and demonstrate that the detected clonal and subclonal variants have important prognostic consequences.

Mutations are typically perceived as random, independent events. We describe here nonrandom clustered mutations in yeast and in human cancers. Genome sequencing of yeast grown under chronic alkylation damage identified mutation clusters that extend up to 200 kb. A predominance of “strand-coordinated” changes of either cytosines or guanines in the same strand, mutation patterns, and genetic controls indicated that simultaneous mutations were generated by base alkylation in abnormally long single-strand {DNA} ({ssDNA)} formed at double-strand breaks ({DSBs)} and replication forks. Significantly, we found mutation clusters with analogous features in sequenced human cancers. Strand-coordinated clusters of mutated cytosines or guanines often resided near chromosome rearrangement breakpoints and were highly enriched with a motif targeted by {APOBEC} family cytosine-deaminases, which strongly prefer {ssDNA.} These data indicate that hypermutation via multiple simultaneous changes in randomly formed {ssDNA} is a general phenomenon that may be an important mechanism producing rapid genetic variation.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled a comprehensive dissection of the cancer genome clarifying a large number of somatic mutations in a wide variety of cancer types. A number of methods have been proposed for mutation calling based on a large amount of sequencing data, which is accomplished in most cases by statistically evaluating the difference in the observed allele frequencies of possible single nucleotide variants between tumours and paired normal samples. However, an accurate detection of mutations remains a challenge under low sequencing depths or tumour contents. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel method, Empirical Bayesian mutation Calling ({https://github.com/friend1ws/EBCall)}, for detecting somatic mutations. Unlike previous methods, the proposed method discriminates somatic mutations from sequencing errors based on an empirical Bayesian framework, where the model parameters are estimated using sequencing data from multiple non-paired normal samples. Using 13 whole-exome sequencing data with 87.5–206.3 mean sequencing depths, we demonstrate that our method not only outperforms several existing methods in the calling of mutations with moderate allele frequencies but also enables accurate calling of mutations with low allele frequencies (≤10\%) harboured within a minor tumour subpopulation, thus allowing for the deciphering of fine substructures within a tumour specimen.},

The top classes are dominated by either mutations (M class) or copy number changes (C class). This distinction is clearest at the extremes of genomic instability, indicating the presence of different oncogenic processes. The full hierarchy shows functional event patterns characteristic of multiple cross-tissue groups of tumors, termed oncogenic signature classes. Targetable functional events in a tumor class are suggestive of class-specific combination therapy. These results may assist in the definition of clinical trials to match actionable oncogenic signatures with personalized therapies.},

A single dose of near-{IR} ({NIR)-absorbing}, 150-nm nanoshells was infused i.v. and allowed time to passively accumulate in the intracranial tumors, which served as a proxy for an orthotopic brain metastasis. The nanoshells accumulated within the intracranial {cTVT}, suggesting that its neovasculature represented an interruption of the normal blood-brain barrier. Tumors were thermally ablated by percutaneous, optical fiber-delivered, {NIR} radiation using a 3.5-W average, 3-minute laser dose at 808 nm that selectively elevated the temperature of tumor tissue to 65.8 +/- 4.1 degrees C. Identical laser doses applied to normal white and gray matter on the contralateral side of the brain yielded sublethal temperatures of 48.6 +/- 1.1 degrees C. The laser dose was designed to minimize thermal damage to normal brain tissue in the absence of nanoshells and compensate for variability in the accumulation of nanoshells in tumor. Postmortem histopathology of treated brain sections showed the effectiveness and selectivity of the nanoshell-assisted thermal ablation.},

A long interspersed nuclear element ({LINE)} insertion is found specifically and constantly in the 5' end of the {CTVT} cell c-myc gene, outside the first exon. The rearranged {LINE-c-myc} gene sequence has been used with polymerase chain reaction ({PCR)} to diagnose {CTVT.} However, in {CTVT} cells, the total length of the inserted {LINE} gene is not constant. In this experiment, variation in the inserted {LINE} gene was studied to determine which parts of the {LINE} sequence can be used as primers to identify {CTVT} cells with in situ {PCR} ({IS} {PCR).} The {LINE} gene was inserted between the {TATA} boxes in the promoter region of c-myc. In {CTVT} cells, deletions of different lengths are frequent in this gene. However, the 550-bp segment at the 5' end of the {LINE-c-myc} gene was stable. Thus, primers were designed to cover the stable 0.55-kb segment from the 5' end outside the first exon of the c-myc gene to the 5' end of {LINE} gene stable segment. With these primers and {IS} {PCR}, individual {CTVT} cells in formalin-fixed tissue sections and {CTVT} cultures were identified. Cells from other canine tumors were negative for this gene. In addition, the {CTVT-specific}, 0.55-kb segment was not found in any spindle-shaped cells from progressive or regressive phase {CTVT.} The {IS} {PCR} technique also did not detect any positive spindle-shaped cells in {CTVT} cell cultures.

{MYC} contributes to the pathogenesis of a majority of human cancers, yet strategies to modulate the function of the c-Myc oncoprotein do not exist. Toward this objective, we have targeted {MYC} transcription by interfering with chromatin-dependent signal transduction to {RNA} polymerase, specifically by inhibiting the acetyl-lysine recognition domains (bromodomains) of putative coactivator proteins implicated in transcriptional initiation and elongation. Using a selective small-molecule bromodomain inhibitor, {JQ1}, we identify {BET} bromodomain proteins as regulatory factors for c-Myc. {BET} inhibition by {JQ1} downregulates {MYC} transcription, followed by genome-wide downregulation of Myc-dependent target genes. In experimental models of multiple myeloma, a Myc-dependent hematologic malignancy, {JQ1} produces a potent antiproliferative effect associated with cell-cycle arrest and cellular senescence. Efficacy of {JQ1} in three murine models of multiple myeloma establishes the therapeutic rationale for {BET} bromodomain inhibition in this disease and other malignancies characterized by pathologic activation of c-Myc.

	abstract = {Motivation: With the advent of relatively affordable high-throughput technologies, {DNA} sequencing of cancers is now common practice in cancer research projects and will be increasingly used in clinical practice to inform diagnosis and treatment. Somatic (cancer-only) single nucleotide variants ({SNVs)} are the simplest class of mutation, yet their identification in {DNA} sequencing data is confounded by germline polymorphisms, tumour heterogeneity and sequencing and analysis errors. Four recently published algorithms for the detection of somatic {SNV} sites in matched cancer–normal sequencing datasets are {VarScan}, {SomaticSniper}, {JointSNVMix} and Strelka. In this analysis, we apply these four {SNV} calling algorithms to cancer–normal Illumina exome sequencing of a chronic myeloid leukaemia ({CML)} patient. The candidate {SNV} sites returned by each algorithm are filtered to remove likely false positives, then characterized and compared to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of each {SNV} calling algorithm.
Results: Comparing the candidate {SNV} sets returned by {VarScan}, {SomaticSniper}, {JointSNVMix2} and Strelka revealed substantial differences with respect to the number and character of sites returned; the somatic probability scores assigned to the same sites; their susceptibility to various sources of noise; and their sensitivities to low-allelic-fraction candidates.

We find that complex breakpoint clusters are extremely common: 154 clusters comprise 25\% of all somatic breakpoints, and 75\% of tumors exhibit at least one complex cluster. Based on copy number state profiling, 63\% of breakpoint clusters are consistent with being {CGRs} that arose through a single mutational event. {CGRs} have diverse architectures including focal breakpoint clusters, large-scale rearrangements joining clusters from one or more chromosomes, and staggeringly complex chromothripsis events. Notably, chromothripsis has a significantly higher incidence in glioblastoma samples (39\%) relative to other tumor types (9\%). Chromothripsis breakpoints also show significantly elevated intra-tumor allele frequencies relative to simple {SVs}, which indicates that they arise early during tumorigenesis or confer selective advantage. Finally, assembly and analysis of 4002 somatic and 6982 germline breakpoint sequences reveal that somatic breakpoints show significantly less microhomology and fewer templated insertions than germline breakpoints, and this effect is stronger at {CGRs} than at simple variants. These results are inconsistent with replication-based models of {CGR} genesis and strongly argue that nonhomologous repair of concurrently arising {DNA} double-strand breaks is the predominant mechanism underlying complex cancer genome rearrangements.},

The mechanisms behind the transition from the P-to R-phases are not well understood. In this study, in order to determine the proliferation characteristics of {CTVT}, we evaluated telomerase activity and enumerated nuclear organizing regions ({AgNOR)} and proliferating cell nuclear antigen ({PCNA).} It was found that {CTVT} cells from the P-and R-phases were both positive for telomerase activity, although it was lower in the R-phase. Evaluations of telomerase activity should take into account the stage of mitosis. Although, in the majority of cases, telomerase activity can be used to differentiate between benign and malignant tumors in dogs, other factors or markers should also be used to obtain accurate diagnoses. The {PCNA-positive} rate and the number and area of {AgNOR} per cell increased much more in the P-phase than the R-phase. However, the {AgNOR} values were always higher. Thus, the {AgNOR} count can be used to distinguish the P-and R-phases of {CTVT.} In addition, mitotic figures were much higher in number in the P-phase as compared to the R-phase. We believe that, during spontaneous regression of {CTVT} cells, slow tumor cell proliferation must contribute to the decrease in tumor size. However, shortening of tumor cell telomeres is not directly involved in this process. Other factors, such as expression of {MHC} antigens on {CTVT} cells, humoral immunity, cytokines released by the inflammatory cells and, especially, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes may contribute to {CTVT} regression.},

Therefore, this tumor does not originate from host cell transformation. Although {CTVT} has a monophyletic origin, several studies have shown the presence of genetic diversity which was probably acquired after the development of its original clone. To investigate the genetic diversity of {CTVT} in Mexico and its relation with {CTVTs} disseminated worldwide, we sequenced a fragment of mitochondrial {DNA} in 50 tumor samples and matched blood samples from dog hosts from Mexico. We found ten new haplotypes in tumor samples, which were all distinct from their matched host. The {TVT1} haplotype was the most frequent in our samples, suggesting that it could be the origin of the others. We found that haplotypes in Mexico and other countries are distributed in two well-defined clusters. Our data also suggest a close relationship among American haplotypes (Mexico, {USA}, Chile and Brazil). Interestingly, these American haplotypes were also closely related to Asian haplotypes. Taking into account the estimated timing of the origin of {CTVT}, we propose that {CTVT} might have originated in Asia; consequently, haplotypes currently present in America could descend from Asiatic lineages.},

In any given study there will be many other variables at play, such as the effects of age and sex on the disease. We show that in studies where the expression levels of thousands of genes are measured at once, these issues become surprisingly critical. Due to the complexity of our genomes, environment, and demographic features, there are many sources of variation when analyzing gene expression levels. In any given study, it is impossible to measure every single variable that may be influencing how our genes are expressed. Despite this, we show that by considering all expression levels simultaneously, one can actually recover the effects of these important missed variables and essentially produce an analysis as if all relevant variables were included. As opposed to traditional studies, the massive amount of data available in this setting is what makes the method, called surrogate variable analysis, possible.

Rearrangements involving one or a few chromosomes crisscross back and forth across involved regions, generating frequent oscillations between two copy number states. These genomic hallmarks are highly improbable if rearrangements accumulate over time and instead imply that nearly all occur during a single cellular catastrophe. The stamp of chromothripsis can be seen in at least 2\%-3\% of all cancers, across many subtypes, and is present in ∼25\% of bone cancers. We find that one, or indeed more than one, cancer-causing lesion can emerge out of the genomic crisis.

As vector delivery is (yet) commonly not targeted to a specific site in the host genome, and vector integration may lead to unwanted cellular gene deregulation, the comprehensive analysis of vector locations is a crucial approach to assess vector biosafety and to follow the fate of the gene corrected cells in vivo. The retrieved vector integration sites are unique for each transduced cell clone, thereby serving as a molecular marker and allowing to track distinct cell clones in various samples. Today, several {PCR-based} methods are available for the identification and characterization of unknown flanking {DNA} sequences (Mueller and Wold Science 246:780-786, 1989; Paruzynski et al.

Thereof, the linear amplification-mediated {PCR} ({LAM-PCR)} proved to exhibit the highest sensitivity, allowing the detection of miscellaneous vector integration sites in one sample. The broad application spectrum and robustness of {LAM-PCR} has been approved by its application as a tool for the molecular follow up of gene-modified cells in preclinical and clinical gene therapy trials (Li et al.

                                    of latent variables on the ranking of hypotheses. Our method,
                                    called {LEAPP}, statistically isolates the latent variables from
                                    the primary one. In simulations, it gives better ordering of
                                    hypotheses than competing methods such as {SVA} and {EIGENSTRAT.}
                                    For an illustration, we turn to data from the {AGEMAP} study
                                    relating gene expression to age for 16 tissues in the mouse.
                                    {LEAPP} generates rankings with greater consistency across tissues
                                    than the rankings attained by the other methods.},

However, the massive data sets generated by {NGS--the} 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases--make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit ({GATK)}, a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation {DNA} sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of {MapReduce.} The {GATK} provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the {GATK} framework for correctness, stability, and {CPU} and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the {GATK} by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP)} calling. We conclude that the {GATK} programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust {NGS} tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.},

	abstract = {Tasmanian devil facial tumor disease ({DFTD)} and canine transmissible venereal tumor ({CTVT)} are highly unusual cancers capable of being transmitted between animals as an allograft. The concept that these tumors represent a cancer stem-cell process has never been formally evaluated. For each, evidence of self-renewal is found in the natural history of these tumors in the wild, tumor initiation in recipient animals, and serial transplantation studies. Additional data for stem-cell-specific genes and markers in {DFTD} also exist. Although both tumor types manifest as undifferentiated cancers, immunocytohistochemistry supports a histiocytic phenotype for {CTVT} and a neural crest origin, possibly a Schwann-cell phenotype, for {DFTD.} In these data, differential expression of lineage markers is seen which may suggest some capacity for differentiation toward a heterogeneous variety of cell types. It is proposed that {DFTD} and {CTVT} may represent and may serve as models of the cancer stem-cell process, but formal investigation is required to clarify this. Appreciation of any such role may act as a stimulus to ongoing research in the pathology of {DFTD} and {CTVT}, including further characterization of their origin and phenotype and possible therapeutic approaches. Additionally, they may provide valuable models for future studies of their analogous human cancers, including any putative {CSC} component.},

This result suggests that T lymphocytes in addition to B cells, plasma cells expressing {IgG}, {IgG2} and {IgG4}, and macrophages participate in the effective immune response against {CTVT} and mediate spontaneous regression of the tumour. {MHC} Class {II} antigen was expressed by infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages, and also by fibroblasts within and around the tumours. Class {II} was also expressed by a variable number of neoplastic cells, particularly those in regressing or stable tumours with a marked lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

To develop a murine model for canine transmissible venereal tumor ({CTVT).}


{ANIMALS}

Thirty-three 6-week-old {NOD/LtSz-scid} ({NOD/SCID)} mice and seven 6-week-old {C57BL/6J} mice.


{PROCEDURE}

Samples of {CTVT} were excised from a 3-year-old dog and inoculated {SC} into ten 6-week-old {NOD/SCID} mice to induce growth of xenograft transmissible venereal tumor ({XTVT).} To establish mouse-to-mouse transmission, samples of {XTVT} were removed and inoculated {SC} into 4 groups of 6-week-old {NOD/SCID} mice and into a control group. Samples of {CTVT} were also inoculated into immunocompetent {C57BL/6J} mice for a mouse antibody production ({MAP)} test. The canine and xenografted tumors were evaluated cytologically and histologically, and polymerase chain reaction was performed for detection of the rearranged {LINE/c-MYC} junction.


{RESULTS}

8 of 10 {NOD/SCID} mice that were inoculated with {CTVT} developed tumors 3 to 10 weeks after inoculation. In the second-generation xenograft, all mice developed tumors by postinoculation day 47; 1 X 10(6) of {XTVT} cells were enough to create a xenograft. Metastases developed in 4 of 20 mice. Xenografted and metastatic tumors retained cytologic, histologic, and molecular characteristics of {CTVT.} Results of the {MAP} test were negative for all pathogens.


{CONCLUSION}

We established an {NOD/SCID} murine model for {XTVT} and metastasis of {CTVT.} This model should facilitate study of tumor transplantation, progression, and metastasis and should decrease or eliminate the need for maintaining allogenic transfer in dogs.},

Three principles seem to be almost universal: regulatory interactions are cooperative; regulatory decisions are made by large dynamic protein complexes; and regulation is intricately networked. A fourth principle, although not universal, is remarkably common: regulatory proteins are actively placed where they are needed. Here, I argue that the true nature of cell signalling and our perceptions of it are in a state of discord.

The results indicate the existence of 3 temporal tumor types, which can either be genetically stable, linearly evolving, or heterogeneous clonal mixtures with shifting predominant clones. A detailed analysis of one high-risk patient sampled at 7 time points over the entire disease course identified 2 competing subclones that alternate in a back and forth manner for dominance with therapy until one clone underwent a dramatic linear evolution. With the use of the {Vk*MYC} genetically engineered mouse model of myeloma we modeled this competition between subclones for predominance occurring spontaneously and with therapeutic selection.},

This species, now confined to Tasmania, is endangered from the emergence of a transmissible cancer, devil facial tumor disease ({DFTD).} In the present study, we use cytogenetic and molecular techniques to examine the stability of devil facial tumor ({DFT)} cell lines across time and space. This article describes disease progression from February 2004 to June 2011. We demonstrate evolutionary changes in the disease, which affects devils in different sites across Tasmania and over a period of several years, producing several chromosomal variants (strains) that are capable of transmission between devils. We describe the evolution of {DFTs} in the field and speculate on the possible impacts on the disease, including (1) development of less aggressive forms of the disease; (2) development of more aggressive forms of the disease; (3) development of forms capable of affecting closely related species of dasyurids (e.g., quolls); (4) extinction of the disease as it acquires additional deleterious mutations that affect either cell viability or transmissibility; and (5) co-evolution of the disease and the host. We also speculate about the future of the Tasmanian devil in the wild. We note that although {DFTs} are regarded as unstable by comparison with another much older transmissible cancer, canine transmissible venereal tumor ({CTVT)}, the potential for development of less aggressive forms of {DFTs} or for development of resistance in devils is limited by devils' small numbers, low genetic diversity, and restricted geographical distribution.},

Many single-nucleotide substitutions in cancer genomes arise because of errors in {DNA} replication, which is spatio-temporally stratified. Here we propose that {DNA} replication patterns help shape the mutational landscapes of normal and cancer genomes. Using data on five fully sequenced cancer types and two personal genomes, we determined that the frequency of intergenic single-nucleotide substitution is significantly higher in late {DNA} replication timing regions, even after controlling for a number of genomic features. Furthermore, some substitution signatures are more frequent in certain {DNA} replication timing zones. Finally, integrating data on higher-order nuclear organization, we found that genomic regions in close spatial proximity to late-replicating domains display similar mutation spectra as the late-replicating regions themselves. These data suggest that {DNA} replication timing together with higher-order genomic organization contribute to the patterns of single-nucleotide substitution in normal and cancer genomes.

	abstract = {In dogs, the canine transmissible venereal tumor ({CTVT)} is the only neoplasm which is not produced by neoplastic transformation of normal cells; the tumor is transmitted from the affected dog to healthy dogs by implantation of one or various clones of cancer cells. Thus, the {CTVT} of dogs analyzed in various countries reveals similar genetic characteristics and consequently {CTVT} is considered to have a clonal origin. The {CTVTs} obtained from dogs in Korea showed the {T963C} mutation on {TP53} gene; this mutation was thought to be a molecular alteration which participates in the origin of the ancestral clone, {CTVT.} Nonetheless, this supposed mutation has not been identified in other studies which were carried out for the purpose of clarifying the clonal origin of {CTVT.} Thus we have considered it important to identify the role of the {T963C} mutation of the {TP53} gene in the clonal origin of {CTVT} in dogs. Consequently the region which includes the mutation of the {TP53} gene in twenty samples of {CTVT} obtained from various canine breeds was {PCR} amplified and afterwards its sequence of nucleotides was determined. We conclude that this mutation did not participate in the clonal origin of the tumor, but was acquired at a later stage.},

Using both published studies and our own analyses, we argue that batch effects (as well as other technical and biological artefacts) are widespread and critical to address.

	abstract = {Canine transmissible venereal tumor ({CTVT)} is an infectious disease of dogs. Remarkably, the infectious agent is the cancerous cell itself. To investigate its origin and spread, we collected 37 tumor samples from four continents and determined their evolutionary relationships using microsatellite length differences and microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization ({aCGH).} The different tumors show very little microsatellite variation, and the pattern of variation that does exist is consistent with a purely asexual mode of transmission. Approximately one quarter of the loci scored by {aCGH} show copy number variation relative to normal dogs, again with little variation among different tumor samples. Sequence analysis of the {RPPH1} gene indicates an origin from either dogs or wolves, and microsatellite analysis indicates that the tumor is more than 6000 years old, and perhaps originated when dogs were first domesticated. By contrast, the common ancestor of extant tumors lived within the last few hundred years, long after the first tumor. The genetic and genomic patterns we observe are typical of those expected of asexual pathogens, and the extended time since first origin may explain the many remarkable adaptations that have enabled this mammalian cell lineage to live as a unicellular pathogen.},

	abstract = {As the sequencing of healthy and disease genomes becomes more commonplace, detailed annotation provides interpretation for individual variation responsible for normal and disease phenotypes. Current approaches focus on direct changes in protein coding genes, particularly nonsynonymous mutations that directly affect the gene product. However, most individual variation occurs outside of genes and, indeed, most markers generated from genome-wide association studies ({GWAS)} identify variants outside of coding segments. Identification of potential regulatory changes that perturb these sites will lead to a better localization of truly functional variants and interpretation of their effects. We have developed a novel approach and database, {RegulomeDB}, which guides interpretation of regulatory variants in the human genome. {RegulomeDB} includes high-throughput, experimental data sets from {ENCODE} and other sources, as well as computational predictions and manual annotations to identify putative regulatory potential and identify functional variants. These data sources are combined into a powerful tool that scores variants to help separate functional variants from a large pool and provides a small set of putative sites with testable hypotheses as to their function. We demonstrate the applicability of this tool to the annotation of noncoding variants from 69 full sequenced genomes as well as that of a personal genome, where thousands of functionally associated variants were identified. Moreover, we demonstrate a {GWAS} where the database is able to quickly identify the known associated functional variant and provide a hypothesis as to its function. Overall, we expect this approach and resource to be valuable for the annotation of human genome sequences.},

We show that there is significant variation in the density of mutations at the 1-Mb scale within three cancer genomes and that the density of mutations is correlated between them. We also demonstrate that the density of mutations is correlated to that in the germline, as measured by the divergence between humans and chimpanzees and humans and macaques. We show that the density of mutations is correlated to the guanine and cytosine ({GC)} conent, replication time, distance to telomere and centromere, gene density, and nucleosome occupancy in the cancer genomes. However, overall, all factors explain less than 40\% of the variance in mutation density and each factor explains very little of the variance. We find that genes associated with cancer occupy regions of the genome with significantly lower mutation rates than the average. Finally, we show that the density of mutations varies at a 10-Mb and a chromosomal scale, but that the variation at these scales is weak. Hum Mutat 33:136–143, 2012. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Cumulative application of all effective filters reduced the error rate by 290-fold, facilitating the identification of genetic differences between monozygotic twins.

	abstract = {Medulloblastoma is an aggressively growing tumour, arising in the cerebellum or medulla/brain stem. It is the most common malignant brain tumour in children, and shows tremendous biological and clinical heterogeneity. Despite recent treatment advances, approximately 40\% of children experience tumour recurrence, and 30\% will die from their disease. Those who survive often have a significantly reduced quality of life. Four tumour subgroups with distinct clinical, biological and genetic profiles are currently identified. {WNT} tumours, showing activated wingless pathway signalling, carry a favourable prognosis under current treatment regimens. {SHH} tumours show hedgehog pathway activation, and have an intermediate prognosis. Group 3 and 4 tumours are molecularly less well characterized, and also present the greatest clinical challenges. The full repertoire of genetic events driving this distinction, however, remains unclear. Here we describe an integrative deep-sequencing analysis of 125 tumour–normal pairs, conducted as part of the International Cancer Genome Consortium ({ICGC)} {PedBrain} Tumor Project. Tetraploidy was identified as a frequent early event in Group 3 and 4 tumours, and a positive correlation between patient age and mutation rate was observed. Several recurrent mutations were identified, both in known medulloblastoma-related genes ({CTNNB1}, {PTCH1}, {MLL2}, {SMARCA4)} and in genes not previously linked to this tumour ({DDX3X}, {CTDNEP1}, {KDM6A}, {TBR1)}, often in subgroup-specific patterns. {RNA} sequencing confirmed these alterations, and revealed the expression of what are, to our knowledge, the first medulloblastoma fusion genes identified. Chromatin modifiers were frequently altered across all subgroups. These findings enhance our understanding of the genomic complexity and heterogeneity underlying medulloblastoma, and provide several potential targets for new therapeutics, especially for Group 3 and 4 patients.},

We constructed a map of unbalanced {SVs} (that is, copy number variants) based on whole genome {DNA} sequencing data from 185 human genomes, integrating evidence from complementary {SV} discovery approaches with extensive experimental validations. Our map encompassed 22,025 deletions and 6,000 additional {SVs}, including insertions and tandem duplications. Most {SVs} (53\%) were mapped to nucleotide resolution, which facilitated analysing their origin and functional impact. We examined numerous whole and partial gene deletions with a genotyping approach and observed a depletion of gene disruptions amongst high frequency deletions. Furthermore, we observed differences in the size spectra of {SVs} originating from distinct formation mechanisms, and constructed a map of {SV} hotspots formed by common mechanisms. Our analytical framework and {SV} map serves as a resource for sequencing-based association studies.},

To test this hypothesis, we analyzed genetic markers including major histocompatibility ({MHC)} genes, microsatellites, and mitochondrial {DNA} ({mtDNA)} in naturally occurring tumors and matched blood samples. In each case, the tumor is genetically distinct from its host. Moreover, tumors collected from 40 dogs in 5 continents are derived from a single neoplastic clone that has diverged into two subclades. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that {CTVT} most likely originated from a wolf or an East Asian breed of dog between 200 and 2500 years ago. Although {CTVT} is highly aneuploid, it has a remarkably stable genotype. During progressive growth, {CTVT} downmodulates {MHC} antigen expression. Our findings have implications for understanding genome instability in cancer, natural transplantation of allografts, and the capacity of a somatic cell to evolve into a transmissible parasite.},

This bias can dominate the signal of interest for analyses that focus on measuring fragment abundance within a genome, such as copy number estimation ({DNA-seq).} The bias is not consistent between samples; and there is no consensus as to the best methods to remove it in a single sample. We analyze regularities in the {GC} bias patterns, and find a compact description for this unimodal curve family. It is the {GC} content of the full {DNA} fragment, not only the sequenced read, that most influences fragment count. This {GC} effect is unimodal: both {GC-rich} fragments and {AT-rich} fragments are underrepresented in the sequencing results. This empirical evidence strengthens the hypothesis that {PCR} is the most important cause of the {GC} bias. We propose a model that produces predictions at the base pair level, allowing strand-specific {GC-effect} correction regardless of the downstream smoothing or binning. These {GC} modeling considerations can inform other high-throughput sequencing analyses such as {ChIP-seq} and {RNA-seq.}},

Furthermore, using {RNA-seq} data we identified multiple fusion transcripts including recurrent gene fusions involving R-spondin family members {RSPO2} and {RSPO3} that together occur in 10\% of colon tumours. The {RSPO} fusions were mutually exclusive with {APC} mutations, indicating that they probably have a role in the activation of Wnt signalling and tumorigenesis. Consistent with this we show that the {RSPO} fusion proteins were capable of potentiating Wnt signalling.

	abstract = {Summary: As applications of genome sequencing including exomes and whole genomes are expanding, there is a need for analysis tools that are scalable to large sets of samples and/or ultra-deep coverage. Many current tool chains are based on the widely used file formats {BAM} (Li et al. (2009)) and {VCF} or {VCF-derivatives} (Danecek et al. (2011); Purcell et al. (2007)). However, for some desirable analyses, data management with these formats creates substantial implementation overhead, and much time is spent parsing files and collating data. We observe that a tally data structure, i. e. the table of counts of nucleotides x samples x strands x genomic positions, provides a reasonable intermediate level of abstraction for many genomics analyses, including variant calling ({SNVs} and {InDels)}, copy-number estimation, mutation spectrum analysis. Here we present h5vc, a data structure and associated software for managing tallies. The software contains functionality for creating tallies from {BAM} files, flexible and scalable data visualisation, data quality assessment, computing statistics relevant to variant calling and other applications. Through the simplicity of its {API}, we envision making low-level analysis of large sets of genome sequencing data accessible to a wider range of researchers.
Availability and Implementation: The package h5vc for the statistical environment R is available through the Bioconductor project (Gentleman et al. (2004)). The {HDF5} system (The {HDF} Group (2010)) is used as the core of our implementation.

	abstract = {Background: Intra-tumour heterogeneity ({ITH)} is the result of ongoing evolutionary change within each cancer. The expansion of genetically distinct sub-clonal populations may explain the emergence of drug resistance and if so would have prognostic and predictive utility. However, methods for objectively quantifying {ITH} have been missing and are particularly difficult to establish in cancers where predominant copy number variation prevents accurate phylogenetic reconstruction owing to horizontal dependencies caused by long and cascading genomic rearrangements. Results: To address these challenges we present {MEDICC}, a method for phylogenetic reconstruction and {ITH} quantification based on a Minimum Event Distance for Intra-tumour Copynumber Comparisons. Using a transducer-based pairwise comparison function we determine optimal phasing of major and minor alleles, as well as evolutionary distances between samples, and are able to reconstruct ancestral genomes. Rigorous simulations and an extensive clinical study show the power of our method, which outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in reconstruction accuracy and additionally allows unbiased numerical quantification of {ITH.} Conclusions: Accurate quantification and evolutionary inference are essential to understand the functional consequences of {ITH.} The {MEDICC} algorithms are independent of the experimental techniques used and are applicable to both next-generation sequencing and array {CGH} data.},

Specifically, whole-exome sequencing using next-generation sequencing ({NGS)} technologies is gaining popularity in the human genetics community due to the moderate costs, manageable data amounts and straightforward interpretation of analysis results. While whole-exome and, in the near future, whole-genome sequencing are becoming commodities, data analysis still poses significant challenges and led to the development of a plethora of tools supporting specific parts of the analysis workflow or providing a complete solution. Here, we surveyed 205 tools for whole-genome/whole-exome sequencing data analysis supporting five distinct analytical steps: quality assessment, alignment, variant identification, variant annotation and visualization. We report an overview of the functionality, features and specific requirements of the individual tools. We then selected 32 programs for variant identification, variant annotation and visualization, which were subjected to hands-on evaluation using four data sets: one set of exome data from two patients with a rare disease for testing identification of germline mutations, two cancer data sets for testing variant callers for somatic mutations, copy number variations and structural variations, and one semi-synthetic data set for testing identification of copy number variations. Our comprehensive survey and evaluation of {NGS} tools provides a valuable guideline for human geneticists working on Mendelian disorders, complex diseases and cancers.},

	abstract = {Epigenetic pathways can regulate gene expression by controlling and interpreting chromatin modifications. Cancer cells are characterized by altered epigenetic landscapes, and commonly exploit the chromatin regulatory machinery to enforce oncogenic gene expression programs. Although chromatin alterations are, in principle, reversible and often amenable to drug intervention, the promise of targeting such pathways therapeutically has been limited by an incomplete understanding of cancer-specific dependencies on epigenetic regulators. Here we describe a non-biased approach to probe epigenetic vulnerabilities in acute myeloid leukaemia ({AML)}, an aggressive haematopoietic malignancy that is often associated with aberrant chromatin states. By screening a custom library of small hairpin {RNAs} ({shRNAs)} targeting known chromatin regulators in a genetically defined {AML} mouse model, we identify the protein bromodomain-containing 4 (Brd4) as being critically required for disease maintenance. Suppression of Brd4 using {shRNAs} or the small-molecule inhibitor {JQ1} led to robust antileukaemic effects in vitro and in vivo, accompanied by terminal myeloid differentiation and elimination of leukaemia stem cells. Similar sensitivities were observed in a variety of human {AML} cell lines and primary patient samples, revealing that {JQ1} has broad activity in diverse {AML} subtypes. The effects of Brd4 suppression are, at least in part, due to its role in sustaining Myc expression to promote aberrant self-renewal, which implicates {JQ1} as a pharmacological means to suppress {MYC} in cancer. Our results establish small-molecule inhibition of Brd4 as a promising therapeutic strategy in {AML} and, potentially, other cancers, and highlight the utility of {RNA} interference ({RNAi)} screening for revealing epigenetic vulnerabilities that can be exploited for direct pharmacological intervention.},

	abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is characterized by relapse after treatment and chemotherapy resistance. Similarly, in other malignancies leukemia cells accumulate mutations during growth, forming heterogeneous cell populations that are subject to Darwinian selection and may respond differentially to treatment. There is therefore a clinical need to monitor changes in the subclonal composition of cancers during disease progression. Here, we use whole-genome sequencing to track subclonal heterogeneity in 3 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients subjected to repeated cycles of therapy. We reveal different somatic mutation profiles in each patient and use these to establish probable hierarchical patterns of subclonal evolution, to identify subclones that decline or expand over time, and to detect founder mutations. We show that clonal evolution patterns are heterogeneous in individual patients. We conclude that genome sequencing is a powerful and sensitive approach to monitor disease progression repeatedly at the molecular level. If applied to future clinical trials, this approach might eventually influence treatment strategies as a tool to individualize and direct cancer treatment.},

	abstract = {Background
Next-Generation Sequencing ({NGS)} technologies and Genome-Wide Association Studies ({GWAS)} generate millions of reads and hundreds of datasets, and there is an urgent need for a better way to accurately interpret and distill such large amounts of data. Extensive pathway and network analysis allow for the discovery of highly significant pathways from a set of disease vs. healthy samples in the {NGS} and {GWAS.} Knowledge of activation of these processes will lead to elucidation of the complex biological pathways affected by drug treatment, to patient stratification studies of new and existing drug treatments, and to understanding the underlying anti-cancer drug effects. There are approximately 141 biological human pathway resources as of Jan 2012 according to the Pathguide database. However, most currently available resources do not contain disease, drug or organ specificity information such as disease-pathway, drug-pathway, and organ-pathway associations. Systematically integrating pathway, disease, drug and organ specificity together becomes increasingly crucial for understanding the interrelationships between signaling, metabolic and regulatory pathway, drug action, disease susceptibility, and organ specificity from high-throughput omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics).

Results
We designed the Integrated Pathway Analysis Database for Systematic Enrichment Analysis ({IPAD}, http://bioinfo.hsc.unt.edu/ipad), defining inter-association between pathway, disease, drug and organ specificity, based on six criteria: 1) comprehensive pathway coverage; 2) gene/protein to pathway/disease/drug/organ association; 3) inter-association between pathway, disease, drug, and organ; 4) multiple and quantitative measurement of enrichment and inter-association; 5) assessment of enrichment and inter-association analysis with the context of the existing biological knowledge and a "gold standard" constructed from reputable and reliable sources; and 6) cross-linking of multiple available data sources., {IPAD} is a comprehensive database covering about 22,498 genes, 25,469 proteins, 1956 pathways, 6704 diseases, 5615 drugs, and 52 organs integrated from databases including the {BioCarta}, {KEGG}, {NCI-Nature} curated, Reactome, {CTD}, {PharmGKB}, {DrugBank}, {PharmGKB}, and {HOMER.} The database has a web-based user interface that allows users to perform enrichment analysis from genes/proteins/molecules and inter-association analysis from a pathway, disease, drug, and organ., Moreover, the quality of the database was validated with the context of the existing biological knowledge and a "gold standard" constructed from reputable and reliable sources. Two case studies were also presented to demonstrate: 1) self-validation of enrichment analysis and inter-association analysis on brain-specific markers, and 2) identification of previously undiscovered components by the enrichment analysis from a prostate cancer study.

Conclusions
{IPAD} is a new resource for analyzing, identifying, and validating pathway, disease, drug, organ specificity and their inter-associations. The statistical method we developed for enrichment and similarity measurement and the two criteria we described for setting the threshold parameters can be extended to other enrichment applications. Enriched pathways, diseases, drugs, organs and their inter-associations can be searched, displayed, and downloaded from our online user interface. The current {IPAD} database can help users address a wide range of biological pathway related, disease susceptibility related, drug target related and organ specificity related questions in human disease studies.},

	abstract = {Considerable time and effort has been spent in developing analysis and quality assessment methods to allow the use of microarrays in a clinical setting. As is the case for microarrays and other high-throughput technologies, data from new high-throughput sequencing technologies are subject to technological and biological biases and systematic errors that can impact downstream analyses. Only when these issues can be readily identified and reliably adjusted for will clinical applications of these new technologies be feasible. Although much work remains to be done in this area, we describe consistently observed biases that should be taken into account when analyzing high-throughput sequencing data. In this article, we review current knowledge about these biases, discuss their impact on analysis results, and propose solutions.

	abstract = {Integrating vector systems used in clinical gene therapy have proven their therapeutic potential in the long-term correction of immunodeficiencies. The integration loci of such vectors in the cellular genome represent a molecular marker unique for each transduced cell and its clonal progeny. To gain insight into the physiology of gene-modified hematopoietic repopulation and vector-related influences on clonal contributions, we have previously introduced a technology--linear amplification-mediated ({LAM)} {PCR--for} detecting and sequencing unknown {DNA} flanking sequences down to the single cell level (Supplementary Note online). {LAM-PCR} analyses have enabled qualitative and quantitative measurements of the clonal kinetics of hematopoietic regeneration in gene transfer studies, and uncovered the clonal derivation of non-leukemogenic and leukemogenic insertional side effects in preclinical and clinical gene therapy studies. The reliability and robustness of this method results from the initial preamplification of the vector-genome junctions preceding nontarget {DNA} removal via magnetic selection. Subsequent steps are carried out on a semisolid streptavidin phase, including synthesis of double complementary strands, restriction digest, ligation of a linker cassette onto the genomic end of the fragment and exponential {PCR(s)} with vector- and linker cassette-specific primers. {LAM-PCR} can be adjusted to all unknown {DNA} sequences adjacent to a known {DNA} sequence. Here we describe the use of {LAM-PCR} analyses to identify 5' long terminal repeat ({LTR)} retroviral vector adjacent genomic sequences.},

	abstract = {Recent studies using the isolation of a subpopulation of tumour cells followed by their transplantation into immunodeficient mice provide evidence that certain tumours, including squamous skin tumours, contain cells with high clonogenic potential that have been referred to as cancer stem cells ({CSCs).} Until now, {CSC} properties have only been investigated by transplantation assays, and their existence in unperturbed tumour growth is unproven. Here we make use of clonal analysis of squamous skin tumours using genetic lineage tracing to unravel the mode of tumour growth in vivo in its native environment. To this end, we used a genetic labelling strategy that allows individual tumour cells to be marked and traced over time at different stages of tumour progression. Surprisingly, we found that the majority of labelled tumour cells in benign papilloma have only limited proliferative potential, whereas a fraction has the capacity to persist long term, giving rise to progeny that occupy a significant part of the tumour. As well as confirming the presence of two distinct proliferative cell compartments within the papilloma, mirroring the composition, hierarchy and fate behaviour of normal tissue, quantitative analysis of clonal fate data indicates that the more persistent population has stem-cell-like characteristics and cycles twice per day, whereas the second represents a slower cycling transient population that gives rise to terminally differentiated tumour cells. Such behaviour is shown to be consistent with double-labelling experiments and detailed clonal fate characteristics. By contrast, measurements of clone size and proliferative potential in invasive squamous cell carcinoma show a different pattern of behaviour, consistent with geometric expansion of a single {CSC} population with limited potential for terminal differentiation. This study presents the first experimental evidence for the existence of {CSCs} during unperturbed solid tumour growth.},
